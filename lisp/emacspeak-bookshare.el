;;{{{  introduction

;;; Commentary:
;;; BOOKSHARE == http://www.bookshare.org provides book access to print-disabled users.
;;; It provides a simple Web  API http://developer.bookshare.org
;;; This module implements an Emacspeak Bookshare client.
;;; For now, users will need to get their own API key
;;; This might change once I get approval from Bookshare to embed the Emacspeak API  key in the Source code.
