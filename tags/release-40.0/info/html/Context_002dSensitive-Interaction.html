  <h3 class="section">6.3 Emacspeak Specializes Aural
  Interaction</h3>

  <p>The content-specific user interaction described above is a
  very powerful feature of Emacs, and this is where Emacspeak
  derives its power. Traditionally, the ability to create buffers
  specialized for working with specific content-types has been used
  by the Emacs community to develop versatile programming
  environments, messaging applications such as mail and news
  readers, and authoring environments. The clean design present in
  all of these Emacs extensions in terms of separating application
  functionality from the user-interface, combined with the
  availability of the entire source code making up these packages
  under the open-source model has laid the ground-work for
  developing Emacspeak as a versatile aural counterpart to the
  product of years of software engineering that has been invested
  by the Emacs community. In short, Emacspeak would not exist in
  its present shape or form without this prior effort.</p>

  <h4 class="subsection">6.3.1 Audio Formatted Output</h4>

  <p>Emacspeak takes advantage of the content-specific knowledge
  available within specialized buffers to produce "audio formatted"
  output designed to optimize user interaction. A basic consequence
  of the above is "voice locking" in specialized modes; a more
  interesting consequence is the implementation of Aural Cascading
  Style Sheets (ACSS) in conjunction with the Emacs W3 browser.</p>

  <h4 class="subsection">6.3.2 Structured Navigation:</h4>

  <p>Emacspeak also exploits content-specific knowledge to provide
  structured navigation of different types of electronic content.
  In many cases, such structured navigation is an extension of what
  Emacs provides by default; in other cases, Emacspeak implements
  the necessary extensions to provide the level of structural
  navigation needed to work efficiently in an eyes-free
  environment.</p>

  <p>Notable among such structured navigation is Emacs' powerful
  outline feature. Notice for example, that the Emacspeak FAQ
  (reached via command <code>emacspeak-view-emacspeak-faq</code>
  bound to <kbd>C-e F</kbd>) takes advantage of Emacs' outline mode
  to allow you to easily move through the various sections. An
  example of content-sensitive navigation is provided by the imenu
  package which dynamically creates a "table of contents" based on
  the content that is being displayed in a given buffer.</p>

  <h4 class="subsection">6.3.3 Navigating The Desktop</h4>

  <p>In addition to navigating individual information objects, the
  Emacspeak environment provides speech-enabled navigation of the
  various buffers that are currently open on the Emacspeak desktop
  via Emacs' built-in list-buffers feature. Emacs' dired
  &ndash;directory editor&ndash; for browsing the file system,
  along with the new speedbar package that combines features from
  dired and imenu round off the suite of navigational tools.</p>

  <h4 class="subsection">6.3.4 Everything Is Searchable:</h4>

  <p>Emacs derives one final advantage from using buffers as the
  basic building block for the entire desktop. Every Emacs buffer
  is searchable via a uniform and powerful search interface. Emacs'
  incremental search works efficiently and consistently to enable
  you locate "objects" of interest either within a given document
  or to locate a given object from among the various objects that
  are currently open on the Emacspeak desktop. This is <b>very
  powerful</b> &ndash;where a GUI user is typically limited to
  quickly locating an object from a relatively small collection
  &ndash;the size of the collection being a direct function of
  available display real-estate&ndash; the Emacspeak user can
  typically work with a far larger collection of objects. This is
  well-suited to the eyes-free environment, where display
  real-estate has no meaning; so bringing up a list of currently
  open buffers and performing an incremental search to locate a
  specific buffer is just as efficient independent of whether you
  have a few dozen or a few hundred buffers open.</p>

  <p>To illustrate the above, my typical working Emacs session
  lasts between two and three weeks&ndash; over that time I
  typically accumulate several hundred open buffers holding a large
  variety of content ranging from program source code to email
  messages and WWW pages.</p>

  <p>Ubiquitous search in the eyes-free environment is
  critical&ndash; as a comparison, when using a conventional,
  purely visual WWW browser, users have no means of easily
  "searching" for say the "submit" button on a WWW page. This
  inability is a minor annoyance in visual interaction, and the
  typical mouse-enabled user <b>never</b> uses the find dialog to
  find a submit button&ndash; it is simply more efficient to point
  at the submit button given the eye's ability to quickly scan the
  two-dimensional display. This luxury is absent in an eyes-free
  environment; as a consequence, blind users confronted by the
  combination of a visual interface and screen-reader are typically
  limited to either tabbing through all the controls on a WWW page,
  or using the sub-optimal find dialog.</p>
