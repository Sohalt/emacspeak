%description 
Emacspeak is a speech interface that allows visually impaired users to
interact independently and efficiently with the computer. Available free of
cost on the Internet, Emacspeak has dramatically changed how the author and
hundreds of blind and visually impaired users around the world interact with
the personal computer and the Internet. A rich suite of task-oriented
speech-enabled tools provides efficient speech-enabled access to the evolving
semantic WWW. When combined with Linux running on low-cost PC hardware,
Emacspeak/Linux provides a reliable, stable speech-friendly solution that
opens up the Internet to visually impaired users around the world. With
support for the freely downloadable IBM ViaVoice Outloud speech synthesis
engine, Emacspeak now turns Linux into the first zero-cost Internet access
solution for blind and visually impaired users.
