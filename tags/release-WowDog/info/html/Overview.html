  <h3 class="section">5.1 Overview of Emacspeak</h3>

  <p>Emacspeak provides a small number of core services around
  which the remainder of the audio interface is constructed. These
  essential features of the software are briefly outlined in the
  following paragraphs; the commands by which they can be
  controlled will be described later in the manual.</p>

  <p>Apart from providing a fluent spoken interface to all of
  Emacs' basic editing functions, Emacspeak also includes software
  modules which add speech feedback to a range of applications that
  can be run from within Emacs. In this sense, Emacspeak amounts to
  much more than a talking text editor; indeed, it can more aptly
  be characterized as a true &ldquo;audio desktop&rdquo;, in which
  speech is treated as a first-class output modality.</p>

  <p>Emacspeak implements a special minor mode, known as
  &ldquo;voice lock mode&rdquo; (see <a href=
  "Voice_002dlock.html#Voice_002dlock">Voice-lock</a>) which uses
  distinct speech characteristics to provide aural highlighting of
  specific textual constructs, such as comments in program code,
  quoted strings and reserved words See <a href=
  "Voice-Lock.html#Voice-Lock">Voice Lock</a>. This facility is
  further extended when Emacspeak is used with the W3 World Wide
  Web browser, to enable the semantic and structural distinctions
  captured by the HTML markup to be communicated efficiently See
  <a href="Web-Browsing.html#Web-Browsing">Web Browsing</a>.</p>

  <p>It is often desirable to exercise control over the
  pronunciation of a word (E.G. a technical term or a reserved word
  in a programming language) within specific contexts. Emacspeak
  maintains pronunciation dictionaries for this purpose, which may
  be customized by the user. Moreover, individual dictionaries can
  be activated selectively, depending for example on the current
  major mode or the name of the file which is being visited See
  <a href=
  "emacspeak_002dpronounce.html#emacspeak_002dpronounce">emacspeak-pronounce</a>.</p>

  <p>In addition to spoken feedback, Emacspeak can generate
  &ldquo;auditory icons&rdquo;&mdash;short sound cues which alert
  the user to significant events, for example the opening or
  deletion of a file, the completion of an action, the arrival of
  an electronic mail message or the creation of a completion
  buffer. Sound cues act as a supplement to the spoken interface,
  and are especially valuable to the experienced user in
  facilitating rapid interaction. Note that in order to support
  auditory icons, the computer must be equipped with sound hardware
  for which the operating system has been correctly configured See
  <a href=
  "emacspeak_002dsounds.html#emacspeak_002dsounds">emacspeak-sounds</a>.</p>
