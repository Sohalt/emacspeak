<p>
One afternoon in  the third week of September 1994, 
I started writing myself a small Emacs extension using Lisp
Advice to make Emacs speak to me so I could use a Linux laptop. 
As Emacspeak turns twenty, this article is both a quick look back
over the twenty years of lessons learned, as well as a  glimpse
into what might be possible as we evolve to a  world of
connected, ubiquitous computing.

<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> The Beginning: Using UNIX With Speech Output In 1994</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
As a graduate student at <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/info/people/raman/raman.html">Cornell</a>,  I accessed my Unix workstation
(SunOS) from a 486 PC running IBM Screenreader.  There was no
means of directly using a UNIX box at the time; after graduating,
I continued doing the same for about six months at Digital
Research in Cambridge &#x2014; the only difference being that my
desktop workstation was now a DEC-Alpha. Throughout this time,
Emacs was my environment of choice for everything from software
development and Internet access to writing documents.
</p>


<p>
In fall of 1994, I wanted to start using a laptop running Linux;
a colleague (Dave Wecker) was retiring his 386mhz laptop that
already had Linux on it and I decided to inherit it. But there
was only one problem &#x2014; until then I had always accessed a UNIX
machine from a secondary PC running a screenreader &#x2014; something
that would clearly make no sense with a laptop!
</p>

<p>
A few weeks earlier, another colleague Win Treese, had pointed
out the interesting possibilities presented by package <i>Advice</i>
 in Emacs 19.23 &#x2014; he had sent around a
small snippet of code that magically modified Emacs'
version-control primitive to first create an <i>RCS</i> directory if
none existed before adding a file to version control. When I
speculated about using the Linux laptop, Dave remarked &#x2014; you
live in Emacs anyway &#x2014; why dont you just make it talk!
</p>

<p>
Connecting the dots, I decided to write myself a tool that
augmented Emacs' default behaviour to <i>speak</i> &#x2014; within about 4
hours, version 0.01 of Emacspeak was up and running.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="sec-1-3"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Key Enabler: Emacs And Lisp Advice</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
It took me a couple of weeks to fully recognize the potential of
what I had built with Emacs Lisp Advice. Until then, I had used
screen-readers to listen to the contents of the visual display
&#x2014; but Lisp Advice let me do a lot more &#x2014; it enabled Emacspeak
to generate highly context-specific spoken feedback, augmented by
a set of auditory icons. I later formalized this design under the
name <i>Speech-Enabled Applications</i>. For a detailed overview of the
architecture of Emacspeak, see the <a href="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/raman/publications/bc-emacspeak/publish-emacspeak-bc.html">chapter on Emacspeak</a> in the
book <a href="http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2007/07/emacspeak-and-beautiful-code.html">Beautiful Code</a> from O'Reilly.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-4"><span class="section-number-3">1.4</span> Key Component: Text To Speech (TTS)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
Emacspeak is a speech-subsystem for Emacs; it depends on an
external Text-To-Speech (TTS) engine to produce speech. In 1994,
Digital Equipment released what would turn out to be the last in
the line of hardware DECTalk synthesizers, the DECTalk
Express. This was essentially an Intel 386with 1mb of flash
memory that ran a version of the DECTalk TTS software &#x2014; to
date, it still remains my favorite Text-To-Speech engine.
At the time,  I also had a software version of the same engine
running on my DEC-Alpha workstation;  the desire to use either a
software or hardware solution to produce speech output defined
the Emacspeak speech-server architecture.
</p>

<p>
I went to IBM Research in 1999; this coincided with IBM releasing
a version of the Eloquennce TTS engine on Linux under the name
<i>ViaVoice Outloud</i>. My colleague Jeffrey Sorenson implemented an
early version of the Emacspeak speech-server for this engine using
the OSS API; I later updated it to use the ALSA library while on
a flight back to SFO from Boston in 2001. That is still the TTS
engine that is speaking as I type this article on my laptop. 
</p>

<p>
20 years on, TTS continues to be the weakest link on Linux; the
best available solution in terms of quality continues to be the
Linux port of Eloquence TTS available from Voxin in Europe for a
small price. Looking back across 20 years, the state of TTS on
Linux in particular and across all platforms in general continues
to be a disappointment; most of today's newer TTS engines are
geared toward mainstream use-cases where <i>naturalness</i> of the
voice tends to supercede intelligebility at higher
speech-rates. Ironically, modern TTS engines also give
applications far less control over the generated output &#x2014; as a
case in point, I implemented <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/aster/demo.html">Audio System For Technical Readings
(AsTeR)</a> in 1994 using the DECTalk; 20 years later, we implemented
<a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130604/t-v-ramans-audio-deja-vu-from-google-a-math-reading-system-for-the-web/">MathML support</a> in <a href="http://www.chromevox.com/">ChromeVox</a>  using Google TTS. In 2013, it turned
out to be difficult or impossible to implement the type of audio
renderings that were possible with the admittedly less-natural
sounding DECTalk!

<h3 id="sec-1-5"><span class="section-number-3">1.5</span> Emacspeak And Software Development</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>
Version 0.01 of Emacspeak was written using IBM Screenreader on
a PC with a terminal emulator accessing a UNIX  workstation. But
in about 2 weeks, Emacspeak was already a better  environment for
developing Emacspeak in particular and software development in
general.  Here are a few highlights  in 1994 that made Emacspeak
a good software development environment, present-day users of
Emacspeak will see that that was just scratching the surface.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Audio formatting using voice-lock to provide aural syntax
highlighting.
</li>
<li>Succinct auditory icons to provide efficient feedback.
</li>
<li>Emacs' ability to navigate code structurally &#x2013; as opposed to
moving around by plain-text units such as characters, lines
and words. S-Expressions are a major win!
</li>
<li>Emacs' ability to specialize behavior based on major and
minor modes.
</li>
<li>Ability to browse program code using  tags, and getting
fluent spoken feedback.
</li>
<li>Completion <b>everywhere</b>.
</li>
<li>Everything is searchable &#x2014; this is a huge win when you
cannot see the screen.
</li>
<li>Interactive spell-checking using ISpell with continuous
spoken feedback augmented by  aural highlights.
</li>
<li>Running code compilation  and being able to jump to errors
with spoken feedback.
</li>
<li>Ability to easily move between email, document authoring and
programming &#x2014; though this may appear trivial, it continues
to be one of Emacs' biggest wins.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
Long-term Emacs users will recognize all of the above as  being
among the reasons why they do most things inside Emacs &#x2014; there
is little that is Emacspeak specific in the above list &#x2014; except
that Emacspeak was able to provide fluent, well-integrated
contextual feedback for all of these tasks. And that was a
game-changer given what I had had before Emacspeak. As a case in
point, I did not dare program in Python before  I speech-enabled
Emacs' Python-Mode; the fact that whitespace is significant in
Python made it difficult to program using a plain screenreader
that was unaware of the semantics of the underlying content being accessed.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-6"><span class="section-number-3">1.6</span> Emacspeak And Authoring Documents</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-6">
<p>
In 1994, my prefered environment for authoring <b>all</b> documents
was <span class="underline">LaTeX</span> using the Auctex package. Later I started writing
either LaTeX or HTML using the appropriate support modes; today I
use <span class="underline">org-mode</span> to do most of my content authoring. Personally, I
have never been a fan of What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG )
authoring tools &#x2014; in my experience that places an undue burden
on the author in terms of drawing attention away from the content
to focus on the final appearance. An added benefit  of creating
content in Emacs in the form of light-weight markup  is that the
content is long-lived &#x2014; I can still usefully process and re-use
things I have written 20 years ago.
</p>

<p>
Emacs, with Emacspeak providing audio formatting and
context-specific feedback remains my environment of choice for
writing all forms of content ranging from simple email messages
to polished documents for print publishing. And it is worth
repeating that I <b>never</b> need to focus on what the content is
going to look like &#x2014; that job is best left to the computer.
</p>

<p>
As an example of producing high-fidelity visual content, see
this write-up on <a href="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/raman/publications/polyhedra/">Polyhedral Geometry</a> that  I published in 2000;
all of the content, including the drawings were created by me
using Emacs.
