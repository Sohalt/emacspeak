Most of Emacspeak user options are now available through
Emacs' customization interface.

said by specific people.

**Speech-enables ansi-color.el

maps these colors to appropriate ACSS style settings to
provide audio formatted output.

** Speech-enables MetaPost Mode:

metapost mode helps authoring and maintaining metapost
drawings.

** Convenience Commands:

All Emacspeak convenience commands have been moved to module
emacspeak-wizards.


** Key Bindings:

Command emacspeak-toggle-midi-icons has been nuked.
In its place, key C-e M-a runs command 
emacspeak-set-auditory-icon-player which can be used to
interactively select the kind of auditory icons used.


*** Personal keys:

 There is a new keymap emacspeak-personal-keymap
for user's personal keybindings --and available through
prefix key C-e x
To bind a command you would write 
(define-key emacspeak-personal-keymap "a"
'emacspeak-speak-other-window)

To accomodate this change, command emacspeak-view-register
is moved to C-e v
and command emacspeak-speak-version is moved to C-e V
