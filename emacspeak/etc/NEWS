** world clock:
Command  emacspeak-speak-time implements a world clock when
called                                 with an interactive
prefix                                 arg (C-u).
When called with two prefix args i.e. C-u twice, it sets the
timezone                                 as well --- useful for
international                                 travel.

** TTS Support:

TTS specific code is now restricted in modules of the form
<synth-name>-voices.el.
Support for additional  TTS engines 
should be modeled on the code in dectalk-voices.el and outloud-voices.el
