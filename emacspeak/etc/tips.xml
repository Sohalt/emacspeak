  <tip id="dired_files" title="Managing Files And Folders">
Files and folders are best managed using Emacs' dired mode
    invoked by  
<command> dired</command>.
Files and folders matching a specific selection 
criterion can be  located using either  <command>
    find-dired</command>
and friends, or more efficiently via 
    <command>locate</command> and
    <command>locate-with-filter</command>.
All of these commands present a directory listing of the
    selected files and folders with the same browsing
    interface; see the Emacs online info pages for
    <topic>dired</topic>.
