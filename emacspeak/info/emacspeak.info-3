dtk-tcl
=======

   Automatically generated documentation for commands defined in module
dtk-tcl.

 - dtk-add-cleanup-pattern:
     ` control e d a '

     Add this pattern to the list of repeating patterns that are
     cleaned up.  Optional interactive prefix arg deletes this pattern
     if previously added.  Cleaning up repeated patterns results in
     emacspeak speaking the pattern followed by a repeat count instead
     of speaking all the characters making up the pattern.  Thus, by
     adding the repeating pattern `.' (this is already added by
     default) emacspeak will say "aw fifteen dot" when speaking the
     string "..............." instead of "period period period period "

 - dtk-notes-shutdown:
     Shutdown midi system.

 - dtk-pause:
     ` control e p '

     Pause ongoing speech.  The speech can be resumed with command
     `dtk-resume' normally bound to C-e SPC.  Pausing speech is useful
     when one needs to perform a few actions before continuing to read
     a large document.  Emacspeak gives you speech feedback as usual
     once speech has been paused.  `dtk-resume' continues the
     interrupted speech irrespective of the buffer in which it is
     executed.  Optional PREFIX arg flushes any previously paused
     speech.

 - dtk-reset-state:
     ` control e d  cap R  '

     Restore sanity to the Dectalk.  Typically used after the Dectalk
     has been power   cycled.

 - dtk-resume:
     ` control e SPACE '

     Resume paused speech.  This command resumes  speech that has been
     suspended by executing command `dtk-pause' bound to C-e p.  If
     speech has not been paused, and variable
     `dtk-resume-should-toggle' is t  then this command will pause
     ongoing speech.

 - dtk-set-character-scale:
     ` control e d f '

     Set scale FACTOR for   speech rate.  Speech rate is scaled by this
     factor when speaking characters.  Interactive PREFIX arg means set
      the global default value, and then set the current local  value
     to the result.

     This function is advised.

     Before-advice `emacspeak-auto': Automatically defined advice to
     speak interactive prompts.

 - dtk-set-predefined-speech-rate:
     ` control e d 9   control e d 8   control e d 7   control e d 6
     control e d 5   control e d 4   control e d 3   control e d 2
     control e d 1   control e d 0 '

     Set speech rate to one of nine predefined levels.  Interactive
     PREFIX arg says to set the rate globally.  Formula used is: rate =
     dtk-speech-rate-base + dtk-speech-rate-step * level.

 - dtk-set-pronunciation-mode:
     ` control e d m '

     Set pronunciation MODE.  This command is valid only for newer
     Dectalks, e.g.  the Dectalk Express.  Possible values are `math,
     name, europe, spell', all of which can be turned on or off.
     Argument STATE specifies new state.

 - dtk-set-punctuations:
     ` control e d p '

     Set punctuation mode to MODE.  Possible values are `some', `all',
     or `none'.  Interactive PREFIX arg means set   the global default
     value, and then set the current local  value to the result.

 - dtk-set-punctuations-to-all:
     Set punctuation  mode to all.  Interactive PREFIX arg sets
     punctuation mode globally.

 - dtk-set-punctuations-to-some:
     Set punctuation  mode to some.  Interactive PREFIX arg sets
     punctuation mode globally.

 - dtk-set-rate:
     ` control e d r '

     Set speaking RATE for the tts.  Interactive PREFIX arg means set
     the global default value, and then set the current local  value to
     the result.

 - dtk-stop:
     ` <pause>   control e s '

     Stop speech now.

 - dtk-toggle-allcaps-beep:
     ` control e d  cap C  '

     Toggle allcaps-beep.  when set, allcaps words  are  indicated by a
     short beep.  Interactive PREFIX arg means toggle the global default
     value, and then set the current local value to the result.  Note
     that allcaps-beep is a very useful thing when programming.
     However it is irritating to have it on when reading documents.

 - dtk-toggle-capitalization:
     ` control e d c '

     Toggle capitalization.  when set, capitalization is indicated by a
     short beep.  Interactive PREFIX arg means toggle the global default
     value, and then set the current local value to the result.

 - dtk-toggle-punctuation-mode:
     Toggle punctuation mode between "some" and "all".  Interactive
     PREFIX arg makes the new setting global.

 - dtk-toggle-quiet:
     ` control e d q '

     Toggle state of the speech device between being quiet and
     talkative.  Useful if you want to continue using an Emacs session
     that has emacspeak loaded but wish to make the speech shut up.
     Optional argument PREFIX specifies whether speech is turned off in
     the current buffer o rin all buffers.

 - dtk-toggle-speak-nonprinting-chars:
     ` control e d n '

     Toggle speak-nonprinting-chars.  Switches behavior of how

     Hungarian notation in program source code.  Interactive PREFIX arg
     means toggle the global default value, and then set the current
     local value to the result.

 - dtk-toggle-stop-immediately-while-typing:
     ` control e d  cap I  '

     Toggle state of variable `dtk-stop-immediately-while-typing'.  As
     the name implies, if T then speech flushes immediately as you type.

emacspeak-ocr
=============

   Automatically generated documentation for commands defined in module
emacspeak-ocr.

 - emacspeak-ocr:
     ` control e control o '

     An OCR front-end for the Emacspeak desktop.

     Page image is acquired using tools from the SANE package.  The
     acquired image is run through the OCR engine if one is available,
     and the results placed in a buffer that is suitable for browsing
     the results.

     For detailed help, invoke command emacspeak-ocr bound to C-e C-o
     to launch emacspeak-ocr-mode, and press `?' to display
     mode-specific help for emacspeak-ocr-mode.

 - emacspeak-ocr-backward-page:
     Like backward page, but tracks page number of current document.

 - emacspeak-ocr-customize:
     Customize OCR settings.

 - emacspeak-ocr-forward-page:
     Like forward page, but tracks page number of current document.

 - emacspeak-ocr-mode:
     An OCR front-end for the Emacspeak desktop.

     Pre-requisites:

     1) A working scanner back-end like SANE on Linux.

     2) An OCR engine.

     1: Make sure your scanner back-end works, and that you have the
     utilities to scan a document and acquire an image as a tiff file.
     Then set variable emacspeak-ocr-scan-image-program to point at
     this utility.  By default, this is set to `scanimage' which is the
     image scanning utility provided by SANE.

     By default, this front-end attempts to compress the acquired tiff
     image; make sure you have a utility like tiffcp.  Variable
     emacspeak-ocr-compress-image is set to `tiffcp' by default; if you
     use something else, you should customize this variable.

     2: Next, make sure you have an OCR engine installed and working.
     By default this front-end assumes that OCR is available as
     /usr/bin/ocr.

     Once you have ensured that acquiring an image and applying OCR to
     it work independently of Emacs, you can use this Emacspeak
     front-end to enable easy OCR access from within Emacspeak.

     The Emacspeak OCR front-end is launched by command emacspeak-ocr
     bound to C-e C-o.

     This command switches to a special buffer that has OCR commands
     bounds to single keystrokes- see the ke-binding list at the end of
     this description.  Use Emacs online help facility to look up help
     on these commands.

     emacspeak-ocr-mode provides the necessary functionality to scan,
     OCR, read and save documents.  By default, scanned images and the
     resulting text are saved under directory ~/ocr; see variable
     emacspeak-ocr-working-directory.  Invoking command
     emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory bound to M-x
     emacspeak-ocr-open-working-directory will open this directory.

     By default, the document being scanned is named `untitled'.  You
     can name the document by using command emacspeak-ocr-name-document
     bound to M-x emacspeak-ocr-name-document.  The document name is
     used in constructing the name of the image and text files.

     Here is a list of all emacspeak OCR commands along with their
     key-bindings:

     key             binding --             ------
