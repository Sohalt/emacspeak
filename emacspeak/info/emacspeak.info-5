     produce tabulated output that works with Emacspeak's table

 - emacspeak-select-this-buffer-other-window-display:
     Switch  to this buffer as displayed in a different frame.  Emacs
     allows you to display the same buffer in multiple windows or
     frames.  These different windows can display different portions of
     the buffer.  This is equivalent to leaving a book open at places
     at once.  This command allows you to move to the places where you
     have left the book open.  The number used to invoke this command
     specifies which of the displays you wish to select.  Typically you
     will have two or at most three such displays open.  The current
     display is 0, the next is 1, and so on.  Optional argument ARG
     specifies the display to select.

 - emacspeak-speak-this-buffer-next-display:
     ` control e right '

     Speak this buffer as displayed in a `previous' window.  See
     documentation for command

     ` control e x a '

     Add annotation to the annotation working buffer.  Prompt for
     annotation buffer if not already set.  Interactive prefix arg
     `reset' prompts for the annotation buffer even if one is already
     set.  Annotation is entered in a temporary buffer and the
     annotation is inserted into the working buffer when complete.

 - emacspeak-speak-this-buffer-other-window-display:
     ` control e / '

     Speak this buffer as displayed in a different frame.  Emacs allows
     you to display the same buffer in multiple windows or frames.
     These different windows can display different portions of the
     buffer.  This is equivalent to leaving a book open at places at
     once.  This command allows you to listen to the places where you
     have left the book open.  The number used to invoke this command
     specifies which of the displays you wish to speak.  Typically you
     will have two or at most three such displays open.  The current
     display is 0, the next is 1, and so on.  Optional argument ARG
     specifies the display to speak.

 - emacspeak-speak-load-directory-settings:
     Load a directory specific Emacspeak settings file.  This is

     ` control e meta c '

     Copy file visited in current buffer to new location.  Prompts for
     the new location and preserves modification time   when copying.
     If location is a directory, the file is copied   to that directory
     under its current name ; if location names   a file in an existing
     directory, the specified name is   used.  Asks for confirmation if
     the copy will result in an   existing file being overwritten.

 - emacspeak-clipboard-copy:
     ` control e control c '

     Copy contents of the region to the emacspeak clipboard.  Previous
     contents of the clipboard will be overwritten.  The Emacspeak
     clipboard is a convenient way of sharing information between
     independent Emacspeak sessions running on the same or different
     machines.  Do not use this for sharing information within an Emacs
     session -Emacs' register commands are far more efficient and
     light-weight.  Optional interactive prefix arg results in Emacspeak
     prompting for the clipboard file to use.  Argument START and END
     specifies  region.  Optional argument PROMPT  specifies whether we
     prompt for the name of a clipboard file.
