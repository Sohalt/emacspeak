emacspeak-realaudio
===================

   Commentary: Assuming you have a correctly configured RealAudio
player, this package provides single click access to starting and
stopping a RealAudio stream from anywhere on the Emacspeak desktop.
Before using this package, make sure that your realaudio player works
outside Emacs. Then set variable Emacspeak-realaudio-player to point to
the program you use to play RealAudio streams.

emacspeak-realaudio-trplayer-call-command
=========================================

   Call appropriate TRPlayer command.

emacspeak-realaudio
===================

   ` Control  cap E  ; '

   Start or control streaming audio including MP3 and realaudio.  If
using `TRPlayer' as the player, accepts trplayer control commands if a
stream is already playing.  Otherwise, the playing stream is simply
stopped.  If no stream is playing, this command prompts for a realaudio
resource.  Realaudio resources can be specified either as a Realaudio
URL, the location of a local Realaudio file, or as the name of a local
Realaudio metafile. Realaudio resources you have played in this session
are available in the minibuffer history.  The default is to play the
resource you played most recently. Emacspeak uses the contents of the
directory specified by variable emacspeak-realaudio-shortcuts-directory
to offer a set of completions. Hit space to use this completion list.

   If using TRPlayer, you can either give one-shot commands using
command emacspeak-realaudio available from anywhere on the audio
desktop as C-e ;.  Alternatively,  switch to buffer *realaudo* if you
wish to issue many nvigation commands.  Note that buffer *realaudio*
uses a special major mode that provides the various navigation commands
via single keystrokes.

emacspeak-realaudio-trplayer-command
====================================

   No global keybinding

   Execute TRPlayer command.

emacspeak-sounds
================

   Commentary: This module provides the interface for generating
auditory icons in emacspeak.  Design goal: 1) Auditory icons should be
used to provide additional feedback, not as a gimmick.  2) The
interface should be usable at all times without the icons: e.g. when on
a machine without a sound card.  3) General principle for when to use
an icon: Convey information about events taking place in parallel.  For
instance, if making a selection automatically moves the current focus
to the next choice, We speak the next choice, while indicating the fact
that something was selected with a sound cue.   This interface will
assume the availability of a shell command "play" that can take one or
more sound files and play them.  This module will also provide a
mapping between names in the elisp world and actual sound files.
Modules that wish to use auditory icons should use these names, instead
of actual file names.  As of Emacspeak 13.0, this module defines a
themes architecture for  auditory icons.  Sound files corresponding to
a given theme are found in appropriate subdirectories of
emacspeak-sounds-directory
