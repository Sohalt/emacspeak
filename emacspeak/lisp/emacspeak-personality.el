;;{{{  Introduction:

;;; Commentary:

;;; This module defines a personality interface for implementing voice
;;; lock via font lock.
;;; Context:

;;; At the time I implemented Emacspeak's voice lock feature in late
;;; 1994, font-lock was still evolving. Most packages that supported
;;; The font-lock module explicitly checked for windowing system and
;;; became active only when Emacs was running under a windowing
;;; system.
;;; Since I wanted emacspeak  to work both within and outside X, and I
;;; did not want to change any of Emacs' code, I implemented
;;; voice-lock  as a separate module.
;;; This also kept things stable as font-lock itself evolved and
;;; changed.


;;; 8 years later, font-lock is now stable.
;;; It is also active outside windowing systems, since Emacs can now
;;; colorize terminals.
;;; This module when complete will simplify the voice-lock code in
;;; Emacspeak by triggering voice locking directly from within the
;;; font-lock code.

;;; Emacspeak modules will still be able to voice lock independent of
;;; visual characteristics --this was a key goal of the original
;;; Emacspeak design and it will be preserved going forward.

;;; As I implement this module, I also plan to fix 
;;; one of the shortcomings in the present voice lock architecture,
;;; where 
;;; the value of property 'personality is a symbol.
;;; This makes it hard to apply voice lock properties cumulatively.
;;; When this update is complete, the Emacspeak core in module
;;; dtk-tcl.el ---function dtk-format-text-and-speak
;;; will be updated to handle the case where property 'personality
;;; holds either a symbol or a list.

;;; Finally, I may add better support for overlays --again this was a
;;; part of Emacs that was at its nascent stage in 1994, but is now
;;; stable.
