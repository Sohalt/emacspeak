;;{{{  Introduction:

;;; Commentary:

;;; This module defines a personality interface for implementing voice
;;; lock via font lock.
;;; Context:

;;; At the time I implemented Emacspeak's voice lock feature in late
;;; 1994, font-lock was still evolving. Most packages that supported
;;; The font-lock module explicitly checked for windowing system and
;;; became active only when Emacs was running under a windowing
;;; system.
;;; Since I wanted emacspeak  to work both within and outside X, and I
;;; did not want to change any of Emacs' code, I implemented
;;; voice-lock  as a separate module.
;;; This also kept things stable as font-lock itself evolved and
;;; changed.


;;; 8 years later, font-lock is now stable.
;;; It is also active outside windowing systems, since Emacs can now
;;; colorize terminals.
;;; This module when complete will simplify the voice-lock code in
;;; Emacspeak by triggering voice locking directly from within the
;;; font-lock code.

;;; Emacspeak modules will still be able to voice lock independent of
;;; visual characteristics --this was a key goal of the original
;;; Emacspeak design and it will be preserved going forward.

;;; As I implement this module, I also plan to fix 
;;; one of the shortcomings in the present voice lock architecture,
;;; where 
;;; the value of property 'personality is a symbol.
;;; This makes it hard to apply voice lock properties cumulatively.
;;; When this update is complete, the Emacspeak core in module
;;; dtk-tcl.el ---function dtk-format-text-and-speak
;;; will be updated to handle the case where property 'personality
;;; holds either a symbol or a list.

;;; Finally, I may add better support for overlays --again this was a
;;; part of Emacs that was at its nascent stage in 1994, but is now
;;; stable.

;;{{{ Deactivate old voice lock routines.
;;; First, we deactivate the voice lock code from module voice-lock.el
;;; by redefining its entry points to be no-ops.

;;{{{ new light-weight voice lock 
(defun voice-lock-mode (&optional arg)
  "Toggle Voice Lock mode.
With arg, turn Voice Lock mode on if and only if arg is positive.

This light-weight voice lock engine leverages work already done by
font-lock.  Voicification is effective only if font lock is on.

When Voice Lock mode is enabled, text is voiceified as you type it:

 - Comments are displayed in `voice-lock-comment-personality';
 - Strings are displayed in `voice-lock-string-personality';
 - Certain other expressions are displayed in other personalities according to the
   value of the variable `voice-lock-keywords'.

You can enable Voice Lock mode in any major mode automatically by turning on in
the major mode's hook.  For example, put in your ~/.emacs:

 (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'turn-on-voice-lock)

Alternatively, you can use Global Voice Lock mode to automagically turn on Voice
Lock mode in buffers whose major mode supports it and whose major mode is one
of `voice-lock-global-modes'.  For example, put in your ~/.emacs:

 (global-voice-lock-mode t)

There are a number of support modes that may be used to speed up Voice Lock mode
in various ways, specified via the variable `voice-lock-support-mode'.  Where
major modes support different levels of voiceification, you can use the variable
`voice-lock-maximum-decoration' to specify which level you generally prefer.
When you turn Voice Lock mode on/off the buffer is voiceified/devoiceified, though
voiceification occurs only if the buffer is less than `voice-lock-maximum-size'.

For example, to specify that Voice Lock mode use use Lazy Lock mode as a support
mode and use maximum levels of voiceification, put in your ~/.emacs:

 (setq voice-lock-support-mode 'lazy-voice-lock-mode)
 (setq voice-lock-maximum-decoration t)

To voiceify a buffer, without turning on Voice Lock mode and regardless of buffer
size, you can use \\[voice-lock-voiceify-buffer].

To voiceify a block (the function or paragraph containing point, or a number of
lines around point), perhaps because modification on the current line caused
syntactic change on other lines, you can use \\[voice-lock-voiceify-block].

The default Voice Lock mode personalities and their attributes are defined in the
variable `voice-lock-personality-attributes', and Voice Lock mode default settings in
the variable `voice-lock-defaults-alist'.  You can set your own default settings
for some mode, by setting a buffer local value for `voice-lock-defaults', via
its mode hook."
