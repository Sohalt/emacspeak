With arg, turn Just-in-time Lock mode on if and only if arg is positive.
Enable it automatically by customizing group `voice-lock'.

When Just-in-time Lock mode is enabled, voiceification is different in the
following ways:

- Demand-driven buffer voiceification triggered by Emacs C code.
  This means initial voiceification of the whole buffer does not occur.
  Instead, voiceification occurs when necessary, such as when scrolling
  through the buffer would otherwise reveal unvoiceified areas.  This is
  useful if buffer voiceification is too slow for large buffers.

- Stealthy buffer voiceification if `jit-lock-stealth-time' is non-nil.
  This means remaining unvoiceified areas of buffers are voiceified if Emacs has
  been idle for `jit-lock-stealth-time' seconds, while Emacs remains idle.
  This is useful if any buffer has any deferred voiceification.

- Deferred context voiceification if `jit-lock-defer-contextually' is
  non-nil.  This means voiceification updates the buffer corresponding to
  true syntactic context, after `jit-lock-stealth-time' seconds of Emacs
  idle time, while Emacs remains idle.  Otherwise, voiceification occurs
  on modified lines only, and subsequent lines can remain voiceified
  corresponding to previous syntactic contexts.  This is useful where
  strings or comments span lines.

Stealth voiceification only occurs while the system remains unloaded.
If the system load rises above `jit-lock-stealth-load' percent, stealth
voiceification is suspended.  Stealth voiceification intensity is controlled via
the variable `jit-lock-stealth-nice' and `jit-lock-stealth-lines'." t nil)

When Lazy Lock mode is enabled, voiceification can be lazy in a number of ways:

 - Demand-driven buffer voiceification if `lazy-voice-lock-minimum-size' is non-nil.
   This means initial voiceification does not occur if the buffer is greater
   than `lazy-voice-lock-minimum-size' characters in length.  Instead, voiceification
   occurs when necessary, such as when scrolling through the buffer would
   otherwise reveal unvoiceified areas.  This is useful if buffer voiceification
   is too slow for large buffers.

 - Defer-driven buffer voiceification if `lazy-voice-lock-defer-driven' is non-nil.
   This means all voiceification is deferred, such as voiceification that occurs
   when scrolling through the buffer would otherwise reveal unvoiceified areas.
   Instead, these areas are seen momentarily unvoiceified.  This is useful if
   demand-driven voiceification is too slow to keep up with scrolling.

 - Deferred on-the-fly voiceification if `lazy-voice-lock-defer-time' is non-nil.
   This means on-the-fly voiceification does not occur as you type.  Instead,
   voiceification is deferred until after `lazy-voice-lock-defer-time' seconds of
   Emacs idle time, while Emacs remains idle.  This is useful if on-the-fly
   voiceification is too slow to keep up with your typing.

 - Stealthy buffer voiceification if `lazy-voice-lock-stealth-time' is non-nil.

When Voice Lock mode is enabled, text is voiceified as you type it:

 - Comments are displayed in `voice-lock-comment-personality';
 - Strings are displayed in `voice-lock-string-personality';
 - Certain other expressions are displayed in other personalities according to the
   value of the variable `voice-lock-keywords'.

You can enable Voice Lock mode in any major mode automatically by turning on in
the major mode's hook.  For example, put in your ~/.emacs:

 (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'turn-on-voice-lock)

Alternatively, you can use Global Voice Lock mode to automagically turn on Voice
Lock mode in buffers whose major mode supports it and whose major mode is one
of `voice-lock-global-modes'.  For example, put in your ~/.emacs:

 (global-voice-lock-mode t)

There are a number of support modes that may be used to speed up Voice Lock mode
in various ways, specified via the variable `voice-lock-support-mode'.  Where
major modes support different levels of voiceification, you can use the variable
`voice-lock-maximum-decoration' to specify which level you generally prefer.
When you turn Voice Lock mode on/off the buffer is voiceified/devoiceified, though
voiceification occurs only if the buffer is less than `voice-lock-maximum-size'.

For example, to specify that Voice Lock mode use use Lazy Lock mode as a support
mode and use maximum levels of voiceification, put in your ~/.emacs:

 (setq voice-lock-support-mode 'lazy-voice-lock-mode)
 (setq voice-lock-maximum-decoration t)

To voiceify a buffer, without turning on Voice Lock mode and regardless of buffer
size, you can use \\[voice-lock-voiceify-buffer].

To voiceify a block (the function or paragraph containing point, or a number of
lines around point), perhaps because modification on the current line caused
syntactic change on other lines, you can use \\[voice-lock-voiceify-block].

The default Voice Lock mode personalities and their attributes are defined in the
variable `voice-lock-personality-attributes', and Voice Lock mode default settings in
the variable `voice-lock-defaults-alist'.  You can set your own default settings
for some mode, by setting a buffer local value for `voice-lock-defaults', via
its mode hook." t nil)
