;;{{{ Introduction 

;;; Commentary:
;;; A voice is to audio as a font is to a visual display.
;;; A personality is to audio as a face is to a visual display. 
;;; 
;; Voice-lock-mode is a minor mode that causes your comments to be 
;; spoken in one personality, strings in another, reserved words in another,
;; documentation strings in another, and so on.
;;
;; Comments will be spoken in `voice-lock-comment-personality'.
;; Strings will be spoken in `voice-lock-string-personality'.
;; Doc strings will be spoken in `voice-lock-doc-string-personality'.
;; Function and variable names (in their defining forms) will be
;;  spoken in `voice-lock-function-name-personality'.
;; Reserved words will be spoken in `voice-lock-keyword-personality'.
;;
;; To make the text you type be voiceified, use M-x voice-lock-mode.
;; When this minor mode is on, the voices of the current line are
;; updated with every insertion or deletion.
;;

;;

;;; How faces map to voices:
;;; TTS engine specific modules e.g., dtk-voices.el and
;;; outloud-voices.el 
;;; define a standard set of voice names.
;;; This module maps standard "personality" names to these pre-defined
;;; voices.
;;; It  does this via special form def-voice-font 
;;; which takes a personality name, a voice name and a face name to
;;; set up the mapping between face and personality, and personality
;;; and voice.
;;; See many instances of this usage in this module.
;;; This special form is available for use from other emacspeak
;;; modules.

;;; Special form def-voice-font sets up the personality name to be
;;; available via custom.

;;; new voices can be defined using CSS style specifications 
;;; see special form defvoice
;;; Voices defined via defvoice can be customized via custom 
;;; see the documentation for defvoice.
