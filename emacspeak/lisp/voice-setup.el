;;; Commentary:
;;; A voice is to audio as a font is to a visual display.
;;; A personality is to audio as a face is to a visual display. 
;;; 
;; Voice-lock-mode is a minor mode that causes your comments to be 
;; spoken in one personality, strings in another, reserved words in another,
;; documentation strings in another, and so on.
;;
;; Comments will be spoken in `voice-lock-comment-personality'.
;; Strings will be spoken in `voice-lock-string-personality'.
;; Doc strings will be spoken in `voice-lock-doc-string-personality'.
;; Function and variable names (in their defining forms) will be
;;  spoken in `voice-lock-function-name-personality'.
;; Reserved words will be spoken in `voice-lock-keyword-personality'.
;;
;; To make the text you type be voiceified, use M-x voice-lock-mode.
;; When this minor mode is on, the voices of the current line are
;; updated with every insertion or deletion.
;;
;; To define new reserved words or other patterns to highlight, use
;; the `voice-lock-keywords' variable.  This should be mode-local.
;;
