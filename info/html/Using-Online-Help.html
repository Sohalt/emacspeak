  <h2 class="chapter">8 Using Online Help With Emacspeak.</h2>

  <p>Emacs provides an extensive online help system for helping you
  learn about various aspects of using Emacs. Emacspeak provides
  online help for its various extensions using this same help
  system. This chapter explains how to use the online help
  facilities in order to empower you in discovering powerful and
  versatile working techniques that will make you more and more
  productive in your day to day computing.</p>

  <p>The online help options are accessed via the <kbd>C-h</kbd>
  prefix key, which must be followed by an additional letter or
  control character to designate the kind of help desired. For
  example, <kbd>C-h t</kbd> <code>help-with-tutorial</code> visits
  the Emacs tutorial in a new buffer; <kbd>C-h i</kbd>
  <code>info</code> enters the Info documentation system, from
  which you can read Texinfo manuals that have been installed on
  your system, including the Emacs and Emacspeak documentation; and
  <kbd>C-h k</kbd> <code>describe-key</code> provides a description
  of the Emacs function which is bound to the next key that you
  type. For learning about the various options that are available
  via the <kbd>C-h</kbd> mechanism described above, view the online
  help for command <code>help-for-help</code> bound to <kbd>C-h
  C-h</kbd> —using what has been described so far, you would
  achieve this by pressing <kbd>C-h k</kbd> followed by <kbd>C-h
  C-h</kbd>.</p>

  <p>Emacspeak users should note that online help is typically
  displayed in a separate Emacs window. Where it makes sense to do
  so, Emacspeak will automatically speak the displayed help. Once
  you’ve asked for help, you can have the displayed documentation
  as many times as you wish using Emacspeak command
  <code>emacspeak-speak-help</code> bound to <kbd>C-e h</kbd>. If
  you want to move through the displayed help a line at a time,
  switch to the buffer where the help is displayed –the buffer is
  called <code>*Help*</code>.</p>

  <p>Often, in adding an auditory interface to an Emacs extension,
  such as a web browser or mail reader, Emacspeak defines
  additional commands and key bindings which enhance the
  functionality of the spoken feedback provided by the application.
  This manual does not purport to document all such commands. It is
  important, therefore, when learning to use the various Emacs
  extensions which comprise the ‘audio desktop’ (see <a href=
  "Audio-Desktop.html#Audio-Desktop">Audio Desktop</a>) that you
  take advantage of online help to obtain details of any
  context-specific features provided by Emacspeak. The following
  two commands are of particular importance in this regard:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><kbd>C-h m</kbd> <code>describe-mode</code> explains which
    major and minor modes are currently in effect, and lists the
    commands and key bindings associated with them.</li>

    <li><kbd>C-h b</kbd> <code>describe-bindings</code> lists all
    of the key bindings which are currently defined.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The importance of these help functions can be illustrated by
  the Emacs/W3 web browser. When point is positioned inside a
  table, certain key bindings are established with which you can
  access Emacspeak commands that make it possible to read the rows
  and columns of the table and explore its structure efficiently.
  To get a description of these key bindings, you can use W3 to
  visit the sample HTML file supplied as part of the Emacspeak
  distribution, and, after having moved point onto the first row of
  the table, issue the command <kbd>C-h m</kbd>
  <code>describe-mode</code> to create a help buffer containing an
  explanation of the features offered by W3 mode.</p>

  <p>Emacspeak supplements the online help facilities available
  within Emacs by defining several commands of its own, as
  follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><kbd>C-h c-e</kbd> <code>describe-emacspeak</code> presents
    a list of standard Emacspeak commands.</li>

    <li><kbd>C-e F</kbd> <code>emacspeak-view-emacspeak-faq</code>
    opens a new buffer containing the Emacspeak FAQ, a list of
    frequently asked questions about Emacspeak together with their
    answers.</li>

    <li><kbd>C-e C-h</kbd> <code>emacspeak-learn-mode</code> enters
    a mode in which the function of every key that you type is
    spoken; this mode can be terminated with the <kbd>C-g</kbd>
    <code>keyboard-quit</code> command.</li>

    <li><kbd>M-x emacspeak-generate-documentation</kbd> prompts for
    the name of a file in which it saves an automatically generated
    summary of all Emacspeak commands.</li>
  </ul>
