  <h2 class="chapter">3 Introduction</h2>

  <p>Emacspeak provides a complete audio desktop by speech-enabling
  all of Emacs.</p>

  <p>In the past, screen reading programs have allowed visually
  impaired users to get feedback using synthesized speech. Such
  programs have been commercially available for well over a decade.
  Most of them run on PC's under DOS, and these are now moving over
  to the Windows environment. However, screen-readers for the UNIX
  environment have been conspicuous in their absence. Note that
  this is now changing with the availability of console-level Linux
  screenreaders such as <code>speakup</code>. Such Linux
  screenreaders provide the same level of UNIX accessibility
  provided in the late 80's by PC terminal emulators running a DOS
  screenreader. This means that most visually impaired computer
  users face the additional handicap of being DOS-impaired &mdash;
  a far more serious problem:-)</p>

  <p>Emacspeak is an emacs subsystem that provides complete speech
  access. It is <em>not</em> a screen-reader &mdash;rather, it is a
  complete user environment with built-in speech feedback.
  Emacspeak has a significant advantage; since it runs inside
  Emacs, a structure-sensitive, fully customizable environment,
  Emacspeak has more context-specific information about what it is
  speaking than its screenreader counterparts. This is why
  Emacspeak is not a &ldquo;screenreader&rdquo;, it is a subsystem
  that produces speech output.</p>

  <p>A Traditional screen-reader speaks the content of the screen,
  leaving it to the user to interpret the visual layout. Emacspeak,
  on the other hand, treats speech as a first-class output
  modality; it speaks the information in a manner that is easy to
  comprehend when listening.</p>

  <p>The basic concepts used by Emacspeak are simple; all
  interactive Emacs commands have been adapted to provide speech
  feedback. Hence, you use Emacs as normal; Emacspeak works behind
  the scene to give audio feedback in addition to updating the
  screen.</p>

  <p>Emacspeak consists of a core speech system that provides
  speech and audio services to the rest of the Emacspeak desktop;
  application-specific extensions provide context-specific spoken
  feedback using these services. Emacspeak currently comes with
  speech extensions for several popular Emacs subsystems and
  editing modes. I would like to thank their respective authors for
  their wonderful work which makes Emacs more than a text

    Linux as the only source of speech feedback since 1994.</p>
