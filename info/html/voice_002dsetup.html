  <p>Commentary: A voice is to audio as a font is to a visual
  display. A personality is to audio as a face is to a visual
  display.</p>

  <p>Voice-lock-mode is a minor mode that causes your comments to
  be spoken in one personality, strings in another, reserved words
  in another, documentation strings in another, and so on.</p>

  <p>Comments will be spoken in
  `emacspeak-voice-lock-comment-personality'. Strings will be
  spoken in `emacspeak-voice-lock-string-personality'. Function and
  variable names (in their defining forms) will be spoken in
  `emacspeak-voice-lock-function-name-personality'. Reserved words
  will be spoken in `emacspeak-voice-lock-keyword-personality'.</p>

  <p>To make the text you type be voiceified, use M-x
  voice-lock-mode. When this minor mode is on, the voices of the
  current line are updated with every insertion or deletion.</p>

  <p>How faces map to voices: TTS engine specific modules e.g.,
  dectalk-voices.el and outloud-voices.el define a standard set of
  voice names. This module maps standard "personality" names to
  these pre-defined voices. It does this via special form
  def-voice-font which takes a personality name, a voice name and a
  face name to set up the mapping between face and personality, and
  personality and voice. Newer Emacspeak modules should use
  voice-setup-add-map when defining face-&gt;personality mappings.
  Older code calls def-voice-font directly, but over time those
  calls will be changed to the more succinct form provided by
  voice-setup-add-map. For use from other modules, also see
  function voice-setup-map-face which is useful when mapping a
  single face. Both voice-setup-add-map and voice-setup-map-face
  call special form def-voice-font.</p>

  <p>Special form def-voice-font sets up the personality name to be
  available via custom. new voices can be defined using CSS style
  specifications see special form defvoice Voices defined via
  defvoice can be customized via custom see the documentation for
  defvoice.</p>

  <p>Automatically generated documentation for commands defined in
  module voice-setup.</p>

      <p>Toggle audibility of personality under point . If
      personality at point is currently audible, its
      face-&gt;personality map is cached in a buffer local
      variable, and its face-&gt;personality map is replaced by
      face-&gt;inaudible. If personality at point is inaudible, and
      there is a cached value, then the original
      face-&gt;personality mapping is restored. In either case, the
      buffer is refontified to have the new mapping take
      effect.</p>
