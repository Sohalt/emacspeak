<h4 class="subsection">9.2.1 Outline Editing</h4>

<p>All of the various outline editing interfaces on the Emacs desktop
allow the user to <em> hide</em> or <em> show</em>
the contents at the different levels of a possibly nested tree
structure.
   Components of this tree structure can be
manipulated as a unit, e.g.,
entire subtrees can be deleted or copied.
Outline editing thus provides an efficient means of obtaining quick
overviews of a document.
</p>
<p>The visual interface displays such hidden content as a series of
ellipses following the visible outline heading.  Emacspeak produces
auditory icon <em> ellipses</em> when
speaking such outline headings.
</p>
<p>The basic <em> outline mode</em> allows the user to specify the syntax
and level of outline header lines as a regular expression.  This
simple technique can be used to advantage in the structured navigation
of large electronic texts such as those available on the Internet from
online book projects such as project Gutenberg and the Internet
Wiretap.  For example, when this feature is activated while reading
the electronic text of a Shakespearean play, the different acts can be
recognized as separate nodes in the logical structure of the document.
The user can then hide the document body with a single keystroke,
navigate the outline headings to find a particular act, and have that
portion rendered either visually or aurally.  Hiding an outline level
produces auditory icon <em> close-object</em>; exposing a hidden level
produces auditory icon <em> open-object</em>.
For details on using mode <code>outline</code>, see the relevant section of
the online Emacs info manual.
</p>
<p>The basic outline facility described above is applicable to all
content being edited or browsed on the Emacspeak desktop.  In
addition, Emacspeak has  other specialized outline editing
modes such as  <em> folding mode</em> that provide extended
outlining facilities.  In mode
<em> folding</em>, the user can create
(possibly nested) <em> folds</em> &mdash; logical containers of content
that are delimited by a special <em> fold mark</em>.  The fold mark is
typically a text string that is chosen based on the type of content
that is being manipulated.  Thus, when <em> folding</em> a C~program
source file, fold marks are created from C~comments.  The user can
<em> open</em> or <em> close</em> any or all folds in a document, and
these actions
are accompanied by auditory icons <em> open-object</em>
and <em> close-object</em>.  By entering a fold, all editing actions are
restricted to the contents of that fold; this proves a simple yet
convenient way of constraining editing actions such as search and
replace to specific portions of large documents.
Folds can be manipulated as a unit and can be deleted, copied or moved.
</p>
<p>Mode <em> folding</em> proves especially effective in maintaining large
software modules.  The technique can be used to advantage by creating
folds for different sections in a module and by further placing each
function appearing in a particular %
section in a fold of its
own.  Complex functions can themselves be folded into sections where
each section reflects a different stage in the algorithm implemented
by that function.  Thus, the technique of folding can be used as an
effective aid in <em> literate</em> programming.  I typically write
software modules by first creating an outline structure using folds
that reflect the various components of that module. Next, I populate
each fold with the function signatures and documentation for the
functions in each section.  When I am satisfied with the overall
architecture of the module, I fill in the function skeletons with
actual program code.  This technique is used extensively in
maintaining  the  Emacspeak code base.
