    Emacspeak:  Redefining Accessibility In The Era Of Web  Computing  
    &#x2013;Zero cost of upgrades/downgrades makes priceless software affordable! 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Emacspeak Inc (NASDOG: ESPK) --<a href="http://emacspeak.sf.net">http://emacspeak.sf.net</a>&#x2013; 
announces the immediate world-wide availability of Emacspeak 41.0 
(NiceDog) &#x2013;a powerful audio desktop for leveraging today's 
evolving data, social and service-oriented Web cloud.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1"> 
<p> 
With several prominent tweeters expanding coverage of 
<span class="underline">#emacspeak</span>, NASDOG: ESPK has now been consistently trading over 
the social net at levels close to that once attained by DogCom 
high-fliers‚Äîand as of November 2014 is trading at levels close to 
that achieved by once better known stocks in the tech sector.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2"> 
<p> 
Emacspeak is a fully functional audio desktop that provides 
complete eyes-free access to all major 32 and 64 bit operating 
environments. By seamlessly blending live access to all aspects 
of the Internet such as Web-surfing, blogging, social computing 
and electronic messaging into the audio desktop, Emacspeak 
enables speech access to local and remote information with a 
consistent and well-integrated user interface. A rich suite of 
task-oriented tools provides efficient speech-enabled access to 
the evolving service-oriented social Web cloud.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4"> 
<p> 
  Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all 
major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular, 
distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated 
system without any undue pressure‚Äîa documented success for 
the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system 
evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at 
the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak 
codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform 
used to develop and distribute the software. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Extensive studies have shown that thanks to these features, users 
consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this 
wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   priceless 
as ever‚Äîit is being made available at the same zero-cost as 
previous releases. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of 
eyes-free social interaction and carries forward the 
well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user 
interface features that eventually show up in luser environments. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a 
crash-prone but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion 
"Emacs is a system from the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak 
evinced surprise at the unusual candor manifest in the assertion 
that it would take popular idiot-proven interfaces until the year 
2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio desktop is 
today. Industry experts welcomed this refreshing breath of 
Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time when users are 
reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) unleashed by 
complex software systems backed by even more convoluted press 
releases.

<h3 id="sec-1-5"><span class="section-number-3">1.5</span> Independent Test Results:</h3> 
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5"> 
<p> 
Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and 
not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without 
adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer. These 
same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped 
functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of 
Emacspeak once pointed out that these results re-emphasize the 
user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is the user &#x2013;and not the 
computer&#x2013; that stops functioning when Emacspeak is uninstalled!".

when correctly implemented can significantly enhance the human 
ability. Emacspeak 40.0 goes back to Web basics by enabling

user environments despite perhaps also being one of the 
oldest. Emacspeak 28.0‚ÄîAKA PuppyDog‚Äîexemplifies the rapid pace of 
development evinced by Open Source software. Emacspeak 27.0‚ÄîAKA

zero-cost Internet access solution for blind and visually 
impaired users. Emacspeak-10.0 &#x2013;(AKA Emacspeak-2000) code named

named BlackLab&#x2013; continued to innovate in the areas of speech 
interaction and interactive accessibility. Emacspeak-8.0 &#x2013;(AKA 
Emacspeak-98++) code named BlackDog&#x2013; was a major upgrade to the 
speech output extension to Emacs. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released as OpenSource on 
the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech interface 
to UNIX workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code 
named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant 
enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went 
further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98 
integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio desktop 
to provide the first fully interactive speech-enabled WebTop.
