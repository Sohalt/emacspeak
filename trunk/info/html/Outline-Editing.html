  <h4 class="subsection">9.2.1 Outline Editing</h4>

  <p>All of the various outline editing interfaces on the Emacs
  desktop allow the user to <em>hide</em> or <em>show</em> the
  contents at the different levels of a possibly nested tree
  structure. Components of this tree structure can be manipulated
  as a unit, e.g., entire subtrees can be deleted or copied.
  Outline editing thus provides an efficient means of obtaining
  quick overviews of a document.</p>

  <p>The visual interface displays such hidden content as a series
  of ellipses following the visible outline heading. Emacspeak
  produces auditory icon <em>ellipses</em> when speaking such
  outline headings.</p>

  <p>The basic <em>outline mode</em> allows the user to specify the
  syntax and level of outline header lines as a regular expression.
  This simple technique can be used to advantage in the structured
  navigation of large electronic texts such as those available on
  the Internet from online book projects such as project Gutenberg
  and the Internet Wiretap. For example, when this feature is
  activated while reading the electronic text of a Shakespearean
  play, the different acts can be recognized as separate nodes in
  the logical structure of the document. The user can then hide the
  document body with a single keystroke, navigate the outline
  headings to find a particular act, and have that portion rendered
  either visually or aurally. Hiding an outline level produces
  auditory icon <em>close-object</em>; exposing a hidden level
  produces auditory icon <em>open-object</em>. For details on using
  mode <code>outline</code>, see the relevant section of the online
  Emacs info manual.</p>

  <p>The basic outline facility described above is applicable to
  all content being edited or browsed on the Emacspeak desktop. In
  addition, Emacspeak has other specialized outline editing modes
  such as <em>folding mode</em> that provide extended outlining
  facilities. In mode <em>folding</em>, the user can create
  (possibly nested) <em>folds</em> &mdash; logical containers of
  content that are delimited by a special <em>fold mark</em>. The
  fold mark is typically a text string that is chosen based on the
  type of content that is being manipulated. Thus, when
  <em>folding</em> a C~program source file, fold marks are created
  from C~comments. The user can <em>open</em> or <em>close</em> any
  or all folds in a document, and these actions are accompanied by
  auditory icons <em>open-object</em> and <em>close-object</em>. By
  entering a fold, all editing actions are restricted to the
  contents of that fold; this proves a simple yet convenient way of
  constraining editing actions such as search and replace to
  specific portions of large documents. Folds can be manipulated as
  a unit and can be deleted, copied or moved.</p>

  <p>Mode <em>folding</em> proves especially effective in
  maintaining large software modules. The technique can be used to
  advantage by creating folds for different sections in a module
  and by further placing each function appearing in a particular %
  section in a fold of its own. Complex functions can themselves be
  folded into sections where each section reflects a different
  stage in the algorithm implemented by that function. Thus, the
  technique of folding can be used as an effective aid in
  <em>literate</em> programming. I typically write software modules
  by first creating an outline structure using folds that reflect
  the various components of that module. Next, I populate each fold
  with the function signatures and documentation for the functions
  in each section. When I am satisfied with the overall
  architecture of the module, I fill in the function skeletons with
  actual program code. This technique is used extensively in
  maintaining the Emacspeak code base.</p>
