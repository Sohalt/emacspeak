  <h4 class="subsection">9.4.2 emacs-w3m</h4>

  <p>emacs-w3m is a front-end, written in emacs lisp, to the
  text-based web browser w3m. It supports tables, images, and all
  major web protocols. It is also fully supported in emacspeak.</p>

  <h3 class="heading">emacs-w3m advantages</h3>

  <p>The main advantage of emacs-w3m is speed. The rendering of web
  pages is done with the external program w3m. which is written in
  c, so it is fast. It also seems not to choke on some web pages
  like the alternative, emacs/w3.</p>

  <p>Another big advantage to emacs-w3m is that it is under active
  development. Problems seem to be fixed soon after they come to
  the attention of the developers and are available very quickly as
  long as you are willing to use the cvs version.</p>

  <p>For those who have limited sight as opposed to no sight at
  all, emacs-w3m displays all graphics within its own buffer. This
  might be a misconfiguration on my part, but there are some images
  that open in an external window when opened from emacs/w3.</p>

  <p>I can also say that I cannot remember a page that wouldn't
  render in emacs-w3m. This is not something I can say about
  emacs/w3.</p>

  <h3 class="heading">emacs-w3m disadvantages</h3>

  <p>Taken by itself, the disadvantages of using w3m are few. Long
  periods between releases can be seen by some to be a disadvantage
  although the alternative browser's time between releases is now
  several years, I believe.</p>

  <p>With hardware or software that support multiple voices, such
  as IBM's Via Voice, one can allow differences in speech to
  indicate differences in document text. For example, headings can
  be spoken in a voice with a lower pitch, links in a higher voice.
  The voices in emacs-w3m are much more limited than those in
  emacs/w3 and not all textual attributes can be indicated. As of
  the writing of this document, <code>pre</code> tags and the like
  cannot be indicated. It has been within the last few months that
  italic text support has been added.</p>

  <p>Another disadvantage is the fact that the rendering in
  emacs-w3m is done by the external process, w3m. Since w3m is
  written in C, it is not as easily customizable from within the
  community of emacs users. Code written in emacs lisp can be
  substituted for code in a running emacs instance, something that
  is not possible in C.</p>

  <p>A further disadvantage is the lack of table navigation, i.e.
  the ability to move from cell to cell in a table to more easily
  understand the information presented. Linearizing the table is
  available but sometimes it is difficult to keep the meanings of
  the columns in your head to discern the meaning. Maybe it is just
  me.</p>

  <p>A disadvantage shared between the browsers is the lack of
  support for javascript. Many sites use javascript for links to
  the next page, such as Reuters web site. This can sometimes be
  worked around using the google transcoder. See See <a href=
  "w3m_002dtranscode.html#w3m_002dtranscode">below</a>, for more
  information.</p>

  <h3 class="heading">emacs-w3m native functions</h3>

  <p>This part of the document is not meant to replace the
  <code>describe-mode</code> information available via the <kbd>C-h
  m</kbd> keystroke or the emacs-w3m info manual. This is by no
  means an exhaustive list of available commands.</p>

  <p>emacs-w3m has considerable functionality and many features
  that make browsing more efficient and convenient. Below are many
  of the functions that are native to emacs-w3m.</p>

  <p><kbd>Cap S</kbd> will query for a search term. By default, the
  search engine used is google. This can be changed with a prefix
  command. To see the available engines, after hitting <kbd>C-u Cap
  S</kbd>, when it asks for the engine hit &lt;TAB&gt; to get a
  list of available completions. Tab completion of partial words
  works here as well. For example, hitting &ldquo;y&rdquo; and then
  &lt;TAB&gt; will complete to the word &ldquo;yahoo&rdquo;.</p>

  <p>Form navigation can be achieved with the right and left
  brackets. This is useful for times where you want to go to the
  input field on a web page without having to tab through the
  links. Google is a good example of where this would be useful.
  The right bracket moves point to the next form, and the left
  bracket moves to the previous, wrapping around at the ends of the
  buffer.</p>

  <p>While in a form, using <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> will submit the form
  with no need to tab around looking for the &ldquo;Submit&rdquo;
  button.</p>

  <h3 class="heading">emacspeak specific functions for
  emacs-w3m</h3>

  <p>Many extensions have been written by the emacspeak community
  to expand emacs-w3m and make it more accessible. Below are those
  extensions.</p>

  <p>While being a variable and not a function, the variable
  <code>emacspeak-w3m-speak-titles-on-switch</code> makes emacs-w3m
  more friendly. It tells emacspeak to speak the document title
  when switching between emacs-w3m buffers. The default,
  <code>nil</code>, will speak the mode line. This is the same
  behavior seen in all other buffers. This speaking of the document
  title is more descriptive than just hearing
  <code>*w3m*&lt;4&gt;</code>. This variable can be customized in
  the usual ways, either in your <samp><span class=
  "file">.emacs</span></samp> file or via the
  <code>Customize</code> interface. If you do set this variable,
  reading the mode line can still be achieved with <kbd>C-e
  m</kbd>.</p>

  <p>The <kbd>j</kbd> command will jump to the first occurrence of
  the title in the document. Each time you use this command in
  succession, it will jump to the next occurrence of the title.
  This is very convenient for web pages that have the title show up
  in multiple places in the document. The web site for The Register
  is a good example of this.</p>

  <p>The <kbd>l</kbd> command uses the default media player to play
  the media stream at point. I believe this is set to
  <code>emacspeak-m-player</code> by default. While beyond the
  scope of this document to describe the installation of mplayer, I
  would highly advise using this media player. With the correct
  codecs installed, mplayer will play everything you will find, I
  believe, with one convenient player that does not require a
  GUI.</p>

  <p><a name="w3m_002dtranscode" id=
  "w3m_002dtranscode"></a><kbd>C-t</kbd> will run the current page
  through the google transcoder. The transcoder is very useful to
  the users of screen readers as it takes care of formatting issues
  like tables. While not usually a problem, There is a function to
  linearize tables in emacs-w3m, but it is not always successful.
  You can reverse this command by giving a prefix argument.</p>

  <p><kbd>M-t</kbd> runs the url under point through the
  transcoder. This command can be reversed by giving a prefix
  argument.</p>

  <p>Extensions have been written to take advantage of much of the
  google functionality. The following describes how to access many
  of these extensions.</p>

  <p><kbd>C-c C-g</kbd> will search the current web site with
  google.</p>

  <p><kbd>C-c C-x</kbd> will extract the current page from the
  google cache. A prefix argument will extract the url under point
  from the cache. This is useful if, for instance, a site is down
  for one reason or another and you absolutely must have the
  information.</p>

  <p><kbd>C-c C-l</kbd> will find pages similar to the current
  page. This is just like the &ldquo;similar&rdquo; link at the end
  of a google search result.</p>

  <p><kbd>C-c C-r</kbd> will browse the rss link under point. One
  reason this might be useful is to first try out the rss feed
  before you configure your rss reader to subscribe to the feed.
  For a easy to use rss reader, see the section below on See
  <a href="rss.html#rss"><code>emacspeak-rss</code></a>.</p>

  <p>The letter <kbd>x</kbd> is the prefix key for the xsl
  transforms. xslt is some powerful ju-ju. It takes a web page and
  does all kinds of cool things with it. These things are listed
  below.</p>

  <p>The command <kbd>x a</kbd> will apply an xsl transformation to
  the current page. one particularly useful transform is to
  linearize tables. This takes the tables and formats them linearly
  down the page as if they were paragraphs instead of table cells.
  This command can be more easily applied with the <kbd>x l</kbd>
  command.</p>

  <p>If you want to always have tables linearized, use the <kbd>x
  a</kbd> command and type <kbd>linearize &lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> and
  then the <kbd>x o</kbd> to toggle xsl on. This will linearize the
  tables in every subsequently visited page for this session. While
  it seems possible to make this happen automatically in emacs/w3,
  I do not believe this is currently possible in emacs-w3m. A
  noticeable increase in speed can be seen in emacs/w3 by turning
  xslt on and using <code>sort-tables</code> or
  <code>linearize-tables</code>. This eliminates the need for the
  browser to render nested tables. Since speed is not such an issue
  with emacs-w3m, I don't bother turning on xslt for the
  session.</p>

  <p>The <kbd>x b</kbd> command will add a &ldquo;submit&rdquo;
  button to forms that do not have one such as the one on the
  emacswiki web site . Submitting forms can be more easily achieved
  with <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>.</p>

  <p>If on a google search page, the <kbd>x h</kbd> command will
  give you only the search hits. An easier way of getting the same
  results is to use the <code>url-template</code> &ldquo;Google
  Hits&rdquo; which returns the same results. Another advantage of
  using the <code>url-template</code> is that it can be done from
  anywhere, not just in an emacs-w3m buffer. See <a href=
  "emacspeak-url-template.html#emacspeak-url-template">emacspeak-url-template</a>,
  for more information.</p>

  <p>The <kbd>x t</kbd> command sorts the tables. It takes the
  nested tables and unnests them. While sometimes useful, this is
  not nearly as useful as the same function in emacs/w3. While
  doing the same thing, emacs/w3 has the capability of allowing the
  user to navigate the tables cell by cell.</p>

  <h3 class="heading">emacs-w3m tips and tricks</h3>

  <p>One issue that might need work is that, by default, when
  tabbing over links in emacs-w3m the url of the link is spoken.
  There are several ways to deal with this.</p>

  <p>One solution, actually two but they accomplish the same
  result, is to include the following code in the
  <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs-w3m</span></samp> file:</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (remove-hook 'w3m-after-cursor-move-hook
          #'w3m-print-this-url)
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">Or, this code in the .emacs file</p>
  <pre class="lisp">
     (add-hook 'w3m-after-cursor-move-hook
          (lambda ()
            (emacspeak-speak-messages nil)))
</pre>

  <p>Both of these solutions, as far as the user can see, seem to
  be equivalent. They differ only in where they are placed.</p>

  <p>The other solution is to leave things as they are. Some users
  mention that they find it helpful to have the url spoken and, if
  they want the text of the link spoken they use <kbd>C-e l</kbd>.
  As with everything else in emacs, it is completely up to you to
  decide what is best.</p>
