    <p>
      Many shell-based tools., e.g., the napster.pl from Lincoln Stein's Napster package can be run effectively from within an Emacs shell.
      In such cases, Emacspeak utilities like <em>filtertext</em>
      and <em>gridtext</em> can be used to advantage in efficiently scanning and filtering the program output.
      Finally, note that 
      when using full screen applications like PINE and Lynx
      when run within the Emacs  terminal emulator (provided
      by package eterm)
      Emacspeak functions like a traditional screenreader.
