on getting Dectalk TTS software for Linux.

You will need to acquire and install the above before being able to
use software Dectalk TTS with Emacspeak.

Once you have Software Dectalk installed, test the speech server by
running 
tcl servers/dtk-soft
and make sure it works before running Emacspeak.
