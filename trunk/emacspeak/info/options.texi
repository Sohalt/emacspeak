Commentary:
A voice is to audio as a font is to a visual display.
A personality is to audio as a face is to a visual display. 

Voice-lock-mode is a minor mode that causes your comments to be 
spoken in one personality, strings in another, reserved words in another,
documentation strings in another, and so on.

Comments will be spoken in `voice-lock-comment-personality'.
Strings will be spoken in `voice-lock-string-personality'.
Doc strings will be spoken in `voice-lock-doc-string-personality'.
Function and variable names (in their defining forms) will be
 spoken in `voice-lock-function-name-personality'.
Reserved words will be spoken in `voice-lock-keyword-personality'.

To make the text you type be voiceified, use M-x voice-lock-mode.
When this minor mode is on, the voices of the current line are
updated with every insertion or deletion.

How faces map to voices:
TTS engine specific modules e.g., dectalk-voices.el and
outloud-voices.el 
define a standard set of voice names.
This module maps standard "personality" names to these pre-defined
voices.
It  does this via special form def-voice-font 
which takes a personality name, a voice name and a face name to
set up the mapping between face and personality, and personality
and voice.
See many instances of this usage in this module.
This special form is available for use from other emacspeak
modules.

Special form def-voice-font sets up the personality name to be
available via custom.

new voices can be defined using CSS style specifications 
see special form defvoice
Voices defined via defvoice can be customized via custom 
see the documentation for defvoice.

Automatically generated documentation
for options defined in module  voice-setup.
These options are customizable via Emacs' Custom interface.

@defvar {User Option} voice-lock-mode
Determines  if property personality results in text being
voicified.
