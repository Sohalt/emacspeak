<h2 id='sec-1'><span class='section-number-2'>1</span> Enhanced Audio On The Emacspeak Desktop</h2>
<div id='text-1' class='outline-text-2'>
<p>
I recently added a set of modules to Emacspeak to leverage some
of the high-end audio functionality available   on Linux machines
on modern hardware. As an example, applying effects such as 3D
spatialization, high-end reverb effects etc. once consumed
CPU cycles to the extent where it was not possible to play with
these in realtime. All these now take less than 1–5% of the CPU,
and that when my laptop is running in power-save mode!
</p>
</div>

<div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-sec-1-1'>
<h3 id='sec-1-1'><span class='section-number-3'>1.1</span> An Audio Workbench Using SoX</h3>
<div id='text-1-1' class='outline-text-3'>
<p>
Sound Exchange (SoX), described as the Swiss army knife of sound
processing, has been around since the time I was a graduate
student. Today it provides a versatile set of tools for editing
and manipulating both wave and mp3 files. Module sox.el
implements a simple Audio Workbench for the Emacspeak desktop.
</p>
</div>
<div class='outline-4' id='outline-container-sec-1-1-1'>
<h4 id='sec-1-1-1'><span class='section-number-4'>1.1.1</span> Pre-Requisites</h4>
<div id='text-1-1-1' class='outline-text-4'>
<p>
SoX with all available auxillary packages for adding support for
various filetypes such as mp3.
The various Ladspa related packages for installing additional
audio effect filters. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class='outline-4' id='outline-container-sec-1-1-2'>
<h4 id='sec-1-1-2'><span class='section-number-4'>1.1.2</span> Usage Instructions For SoX.el</h4>
<div id='text-1-1-2' class='outline-text-4'>
<ul class='org-ul'>
<li>Launch the Audio Workbench via  by  executing <span class='underline'>M-x sox</span>.
</li>
<li>Use <span class='underline'>f</span> to open a wave or mp3 file you wish to manipulate.
</li>
<li>Add any of the supported effects using <span class='underline'>e</span>.
</li>
<li>Use upper-case <span class='underline'>E</span> to add more than one effect.
</li>
<li>Hit <span class='underline'>p</span> to play the result, <span class='underline'>s</span> to save the result to a new
file.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
At present sox.el supports a few effects such as  <span class='underline'>trim</span> for
clipping files, <span class='underline'>reverb</span> for adding a reverb etc., with more to
come as I use it.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-sec-1-2'>
<h3 id='sec-1-2'><span class='section-number-3'>1.2</span> Adding High-End Reverb When Playing Media Streams</h3>
<div id='text-1-2' class='outline-text-3'>
<p>
I use <span class='underline'>mplayer</span> to play both local and network media
streams. MPlayer can apply a wide range of filters to the audio
stream; more interestingly it can also apply effects implemented
as Ladspa plugins.   Package <span class='underline'>tap-plugins</span> implements a large
number of high-quality Ladspa filters, including a versatile
<span class='underline'>Reverb</span> filter.
</p>

<p>
Once you have package <span class='underline'>tap-plugins</span> and its dependencies
installed, and a relatively new version of MPlayer (with support
for Ladspa plugins), you can now apply various <i>Reverb Presets</i>
to your media streams via Emacspeak MPlayer command
<span class='underline'>emacspeak-m-player-apply-reverb-preset</span> bound to <span class='underline'>P</span> in
Emacspeak MPlayer. Package <span class='underline'>tap-plugins</span> defines a total of 42
Reverb Presets, experiment with these when wearing headsets.
Once you have applied a Reverb Preset, you can edit its current
settings via command emacspeak-m-player-edit-reverb  bound to <span class='underline'>R</span>
in Emacspeak MPlayer.
Alternatively, you can pick a default effect to use via Emacs'
custom interface; see option  <span class='underline'>emacspeak-m-player-reverb-filter</span>.
</p>
</div>
</div>



<div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-sec-1-3'>
<h3 id='sec-1-3'><span class='section-number-3'>1.3</span> Defining Convenient MPLayer Shortcuts</h3>
<div id='text-1-3' class='outline-text-3'>
<p>
Finally, You can now bind shortcut keys for launching Emacspeak
MPlayer   from specific locations where you store media, e.g.,
you can have separate shortcuts for <i>Music</i> vs <i>Audio Books</i> –
see command <span class='underline'>emacspeak-m-player-accelerator</span>.
This is best used by customizing Emacspeak option
<span class='underline'>emacspeak-media-location-bindings</span> — just use the Customize
interface to specify  pairs of shortcut keys and media locations.

<h2 id='sec-2'><span class='section-number-2'>2</span> Simple Usage Summary</h2>
<div id='text-2' class='outline-text-2'>
<ul class='org-ul'>
<li>M-x emacspeak-wizards-tune-in-radio-browse brings up  the
browse interface.
</li>
<li>M-x emacspeak-wizards-tune-in-radio-search prompts for a
query and brings up search results.
</li>
<li>Both <i>browse</i> and <i>search</i> get the results back as an <span class='underline'>OPML</span>
feed, which gets displayed as a simple Web page within the
Emacs Web Browser (EWW if using 24.4).
</li>
<li>Items identified as (link) are themselves <span class='underline'>OPML</span> feeds and
can be opened via command emacspeak-feeds-opml-display.
</li>
<li>The initial browse buffer is set up to use opml-display
when you click on link items.
</li>
<li>You can play (audio) links by invoking command
<span class='underline'>emacspeak-webutils-play-media-at-point — this command is
bound to _;</span> in  EWW.
</li>
<li>You need to provide an interactive prefix argument to the
above command to indicate that it is a playlist — so you
actually press <span class='underline'>C-u ;</span> on audio links.
</li>
<li>Many of the audio links do not return a playlist – they
instead return a link that is a pointer to a playlist. Newer

<p>
<a href='http://www.csounds.com/'>CSound</a> is a sophisticated music sound synthesis system with a
strong community of developers.  I've played off and on with
CSound ever since the early 90's  and have always been intrigued
by the possibility of   algorithmically creating new auditory icon themes for
Emacspeak  using CSound.
</p>

<p>
Over the holidays last December, I finally got around to creating
my first complete CSound-generated auditory icon theme – it is
now checked into Emacspeak SVN as theme <a href='http://emacspeak.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/sounds/3d/'>3d</a>. This theme is best
experienced with headphones — many of the generated icons use
spatial audio to good effect.

  Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all 
major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular, 
distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated 
system without any undue pressure—a documented success for 
the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system 
evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at 
the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak 
codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform 
used to develop and distribute the software. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Extensive studies have shown that thanks to these features, users 
consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this 
wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   priceless 
as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as 
previous releases. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of 
eyes-free social interaction and carries forward the 
well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user 
interface features that eventually show up in luser environments. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a 
crash-prone but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion 
"Emacs is a system from the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak 
evinced surprise at the unusual candor manifest in the assertion 
that it would take popular idiot-proven interfaces until the year 
2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio desktop is 
today. Industry experts welcomed this refreshing breath of 
Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time when users are 
reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) unleashed by 
complex software systems backed by even more convoluted press 
releases.

<div id='text-1-5' class='outline-text-3'> 
<p> 
Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and 
not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without 
adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer. These 
same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped 
functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of 
Emacspeak once pointed out that these results re-emphasize the 
user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is the user –and not the 
computer– that stops functioning when Emacspeak is uninstalled!".

<p> 
Emacspeak 41.0 continues to improve upon the desire to provide 
not just equal, but superior access — technology  
when correctly implemented can significantly enhance the human 
ability. Emacspeak 40.0 goes back to Web basics by enabling 
<a href='http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2013/11/reading-web-content-efficiently.html'>efficient access</a> to large amounts of readable Web 
content. Emacspeak 39.0 continues the Emacspeak tradition of 
increasing the breadth of user tasks that are covered without 
introducing unnecessary bloatware. Emacspeak 38.0 is the latest 
in a series of award-winning releases from Emacspeak 
Inc. Emacspeak 37.0 continues the tradition of delivering robust 
software as reflected by its code-name. Emacspeak 36.0 enhances 
the audio desktop with many new tools including full EPub support 
— hence the name EPubDog. Emacspeak 35.0 is all about teaching 
a new dog old tricks — and is aptly code-named HeadDog in honor 
of our new Press/Analyst contact. emacspeak-34.0 (AKA Bubbles) 
established a new beach-head with respect to rapid task 
completion in an eyes-free environment. Emacspeak-33.0 AKA

SocialDog brings the Social Web to the audio desktop—you cant but 
be social if you speak! Emacspeak 29.0—AKAAbleDog—is a testament 
to the resilliance and innovation embodied by Open Source 
software—it would not exist without the thriving Emacs community 
that continues to ensure that Emacs remains one of the premier 
user environments despite perhaps also being one of the 
oldest. Emacspeak 28.0—AKA PuppyDog—exemplifies the rapid pace of 
development evinced by Open Source software. Emacspeak 27.0—AKA 
FastDog—is the latest in a sequence of upgrades that make 
previous releases obsolete and downgrades unnecessary. Emacspeak 
26—AKA LeadDog—continues the tradition of introducing innovative 
access solutions that are unfettered by the constraints inherent 
in traditional adaptive technologies. Emacspeak 25 —AKA ActiveDog 
—re-activates open, unfettered access to online 
information. Emacspeak-Alive —AKA LiveDog —enlivens open, 
unfettered information access with a series of live updates that 
once again demonstrate the power and agility of open source 
software development. Emacspeak 23.0 – AKA Retriever—went the 
extra mile in fetching full access. Emacspeak 22.0 —AKA GuideDog 
—helps users navigate the Web more effectively than ever 
before. Emacspeak 21.0 —AKA PlayDog —continued the Emacspeak 
tradition of relying on enhanced productivity to liberate 
users. Emacspeak-20.0 —AKA LeapDog —continues the long 
established GNU/Emacs tradition of integrated innovation to 
create a pleasurable computing environment for eyes-free 
interaction. emacspeak-19.0 –AKA WorkDog– is designed to 
enhance user productivity at work and leisure. Emacspeak-18.0 
–code named GoodDog– continued the Emacspeak tradition of

ownership. Emacspeak-17.0 –code named HappyDog– enhances user 
productivity by exploiting today's evolving WWW 
standards. Emacspeak-16.0 –code named CleverDog– the follow-up 
to SmartDog– continued the tradition of working better, faster, 
smarter. Emacspeak-15.0 –code named SmartDog–followed up on 
TopDog as the next in a continuing a series of award-winning 
audio desktop releases from Emacspeak Inc. Emacspeak-14.0 –code 
named TopDog–was the first release of this 
millennium. Emacspeak-13.0 –codenamed YellowLab– was the 
closing release of the 20th. century. Emacspeak-12.0 –code named 
GoldenDog– began leveraging the evolving semantic WWW to provide 
task-oriented speech access to Webformation. Emacspeak-11.0 
–code named Aster– went the final step in making Linux a 
zero-cost Internet access solution for blind and visually 
impaired users. Emacspeak-10.0 –(AKA Emacspeak-2000) code named 
WonderDog– continued the tradition of award-winning software 
releases designed to make eyes-free computing a productive and 
pleasurable experience. Emacspeak-9.0 –(AKA Emacspeak 99) code 
named BlackLab– continued to innovate in the areas of speech 
interaction and interactive accessibility. Emacspeak-8.0 –(AKA 
Emacspeak-98++) code named BlackDog– was a major upgrade to the 
speech output extension to Emacs. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released as OpenSource on 
the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech interface 
to UNIX workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code 
named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant 
enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went 
further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98 
integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio desktop 
to provide the first fully interactive speech-enabled WebTop.

<div id='text-1' class='outline-text-2'>
<p>
One afternoon in the third week of September 1994, I started
writing myself a small Emacs extension using Lisp Advice to make
Emacs speak to me so I could use a Linux laptop. As Emacspeak
turns twenty, this article is both a quick look back over the
twenty years of lessons learned, as well as a glimpse into what
might be possible as we evolve to a world of connected,
ubiquitous computing. This article draws on <a href='http://norvig.com/21-days.html'>Learning To Program
In 10 Years</a> by Peter Norvig for some of its inspiration.

<h2 id='sec-2'><span class='section-number-2'>2</span> Using UNIX With Speech Output —  1994</h2>
<div id='text-2' class='outline-text-2'>
<p>
As a graduate student at <a href='http://www.cs.cornell.edu/info/people/raman/raman.html'>Cornell</a>, I accessed my Unix workstation
(SunOS) from an Intel 486 PC running IBM Screen-Reader. There
 was no means of directly using a UNIX box at the time; after
 graduating, I continued doing the same for about six months at
 Digital Research in Cambridge — the only difference being that
 my desktop workstation was now a DEC-Alpha. Throughout this
 time, Emacs was my environment of choice for everything from
 software development and Internet access to writing documents.
</p>


<p>
In fall of 1994, I wanted to start using a laptop running Linux;
a colleague (Dave Wecker) was retiring his 386mhz laptop that
already had Linux on it and I decided to inherit it. But there
was only one problem — until then I had always accessed a UNIX
machine from a secondary PC running a screen-reader — something
that would clearly make no sense with a laptop!
</p>

<p>
Another colleague, Win Treese, had pointed out the interesting
possibilities presented by package <b>advice</b> in Emacs 19.23 — a
few weeks earlier, he had sent around a small snippet of code
that magically modified Emacs' version-control primitive to first
create an <i>RCS</i> directory if none existed before adding a file to
version control. When I speculated about using the Linux laptop,
Dave remarked — you live in Emacs anyway — why dont you just make
it talk!
</p>

<p>
Connecting the dots, I decided to write myself a tool that
augmented Emacs' default behavior to <i>speak</i> — within about 4
hours, version 0.01 of Emacspeak was up and running.

It took me a couple of weeks to fully recognize the potential of
what I had built with Emacs Lisp Advice. Until then, I had used
screen-readers to listen to the contents of the visual display —
but Lisp Advice let me do a lot more — it enabled Emacspeak to
generate highly context-specific spoken feedback, augmented by a
set of auditory icons. I later formalized this design under the
name <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-voicing'>speech-enabled applications</a>. For a detailed overview of the
architecture of Emacspeak, see the <a href='http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/raman/publications/bc-emacspeak/publish-emacspeak-bc.html'>chapter on Emacspeak</a> in the

<h2 id='sec-4'><span class='section-number-2'>4</span> Key Component —  Text To Speech (TTS)</h2>
<div id='text-4' class='outline-text-2'>
<p>
Emacspeak is a speech-subsystem for Emacs; it depends on an
external Text-To-Speech (TTS) engine to produce speech. In 1994,
Digital Equipment released what would turn out to be the last in
the line of hardware DECTalk synthesizers, the DECTalk
Express. This was essentially an Intel 386with 1mb of flash
memory that ran a version of the DECTalk TTS software — to date,
it still remains my favorite Text-To-Speech engine. At the time,
I also had a software version of the same engine running on my
DEC-Alpha workstation; the desire to use either a software or
hardware solution to produce speech output defined the Emacspeak
speech-server architecture.
</p>

<p>
I went to IBM Research in 1999; this coincided with IBM releasing
a version of the Eloquennce TTS engine on Linux under the name
<i>ViaVoice Outloud</i>. My colleague Jeffrey Sorenson implemented an
early version of the Emacspeak speech-server for this engine
using the OSS API; I later updated it to use the ALSA library
while on a flight back to SFO from Boston in 2001. That is still
the TTS engine that is speaking as I type this article on my
laptop.
</p>

<p>
20 years on, TTS continues to be the weakest link on Linux; the
best available solution in terms of quality continues to be the
Linux port of Eloquence TTS available from Voxin in Europe for a
small price. Looking back across 20 years, the state of TTS on
Linux in particular and across all platforms in general continues
to be a disappointment; most of today's newer TTS engines are
geared toward mainstream use-cases where <i>naturalness</i> of the
voice tends to supersede intelligibility at higher
speech-rates. Ironically, modern TTS engines also give
applications far less control over the generated output — as a
case in point, I implemented
<a href='http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/aster/demo.html'>Audio System For Technical Readings (AsTeR)</a> in 1994 using the
DECTalk; 20 years later, we implemented <a href='http://allthingsd.com/20130604/t-v-ramans-audio-deja-vu-from-google-a-math-reading-system-for-the-web/'>MathML support</a> in
<a href='http://www.chromevox.com/'>ChromeVox</a> using Google TTS. In 2013, it turned out to be
difficult or impossible to implement the type of audio renderings
that were possible with the admittedly less-natural sounding
DECTalk!

<h2 id='sec-5'><span class='section-number-2'>5</span> Emacspeak And Software Development</h2>
<div id='text-5' class='outline-text-2'>
<p>
Version 0.01 of Emacspeak was written using IBM Screen-Reader on
a PC with a terminal emulator accessing a UNIX workstation. But
in about 2 weeks, Emacspeak was already a better environment for
developing Emacspeak in particular and software development in
general. Here are a few highlights in 1994 that made Emacspeak a
good software development environment, present-day users of
Emacspeak will see that that was just scratching the surface.
</p>

<ul class='org-ul'>
<li>Audio formatting using voice-lock to provide aural syntax
highlighting.
</li>
<li>Succinct auditory icons to provide efficient feedback.
</li>
<li>Emacs' ability to navigate code structurally   — 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
as opposed to moving around by plain-text units such as
  characters, lines and words. S-Expressions are a major win!
</p>
<ul class='org-ul'>
<li>Emacs' ability to specialize behavior based on major and
minor modes.
</li>
<li>Ability to browse program code using  tags, and getting
fluent spoken feedback.
</li>
<li>Completion <b>everywhere</b>.
</li>
<li>Everything is searchable   —   this is a huge win when you
cannot see the screen.
</li>
<li>Interactive spell-checking using ISpell with continuous
spoken feedback augmented by aural highlights.
</li>
<li>Running code compilation  and being able to jump to errors
with spoken feedback.
</li>
<li>Ability to move through diff chunks when working with source
code and source control systems; refined diffs as provided by
the <b>ediff</b> package when speech-enabled is a major
productivity win.
</li>
<li>Ability to easily move between email, document authoring and
programming — though this may appear trivial, it continues to
be one of Emacs' biggest wins.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
Long-term Emacs users will recognize all of the above as being
among the reasons why they do most things inside Emacs — there is
little that is Emacspeak specific in the above list — except that
Emacspeak was able to provide fluent, well-integrated contextual
feedback for all of these tasks. And that was a game-changer
given what I had had before Emacspeak. As a case in point, I did
not dare program in Python before I speech-enabled Emacs'
Python-Mode; the fact that white space is significant in Python
made it difficult to program using a plain screen-reader that was
unaware of the semantics of the underlying content being
accessed.

<div id='text-5-1' class='outline-text-3'>
<p>
As an aside, note that all of Emacspeak has been developed over
the last 20 years with Emacspeak being the only adaptive
technology on my system. This has led to  some interesting design
consequences, primary among them being  a strong education in
<b>programming defensively</b>.  Here are some other key features of
the Emacspeak code-base:
</p>

<ol class='org-ol'>
<li>The code-base is extremely <b>bushy</b> rather than deeply
hierarchical — this means that when a module breaks, it does
not affect the rest of the system.
</li>
<li>Separation of concerns with respect to the various layers, a
tightly knit  core speech library  interfaces  with  any one
of many  speech servers  running as an external process.
</li>
<li>Audio formatting is abstracted by using the formalism
defined in Aural CSS.
</li>
<li>Emacspeak integrates with Emacs' user interface conventions
by taking over a single prefix key <b>C-e</b> with <i>all</i>
Emacspeak commands accessed through that single keymap.
This helps embedding Emacspeak functionality into a large
variety of third party modules without any loss of functionality.

<h2 id='sec-6'><span class='section-number-2'>6</span> Emacspeak And Authoring Documents</h2>
<div id='text-6' class='outline-text-2'>
<p>
In 1994, my preferred environment for authoring <b>all</b> documents
was <b>LaTeX</b> using the Auctex package. Later I started writing
either LaTeX or HTML using the appropriate support modes; today I
use <b>org-mode</b> to do most of my content authoring. Personally, I
have never been a fan of What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG)
authoring tools — in my experience that places an undue burden on
the author by drawing attention away from the content to focus on
the final appearance. An added benefit of creating content in
Emacs in the form of light-weight markup is that the content is
long-lived — I can still usefully process and re-use things I
have written 25 years ago.
</p>

<p>
Emacs, with Emacspeak providing audio formatting and
context-specific feedback remains my environment of choice for
writing all forms of content ranging from simple email messages
to polished documents for print publishing. And it is worth
repeating that I <b>never</b> need to focus on what the content is
going to look like — that job is best left to the computer.
</p>

<p>
As an example of producing high-fidelity visual content, see this
write-up on
<a href='http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/raman/publications/polyhedra/'>Polyhedral
Geometry</a> that I published in 2000; all of the content,
including the drawings were created by me using Emacs.

<h2 id='sec-7'><span class='section-number-2'>7</span> Emacspeak And The Early Days Of The Web</h2>
<div id='text-7' class='outline-text-2'>
<p>
Right around the time that I was writing version 0.01 of
emacspeak, a far more significant software movement was under way
— the World Wide Web was moving from the realms of academia to
the mainstream world with the launch of NCSA Mosaic — and in late
1994 by the first commercial Web browser in Netscape
Navigator. Emacs had always enabled integrated access to FTP
archives via package <i>ange-ftp</i>; in late 1993, William Perry
released Emacs-W3, a Web browser for Emacs written entirely in
Emacs Lisp. W3 was one of the first large packages to be
speech-enabled by Emacspeak — later it was the browser on which I
implemented the first draft of the
<a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/aural.html'>Aural CSS
specification</a>. Emacs-W3 enabled many early innovations in the
context of providing non-visual access to Web content, including
audio formatting and structured content navigation; in summer of
1995, Dave Raggett and I outlined a few extensions to HTML Forms,
including the <b>label</b> element as a means of associating metadata
with interactive form controls in HTML, and many of these ideas
were prototyped in Emacs-W3 at the time. Over the years, Emacs-W3
fell behind the times — especially as the Web moved away from
cleanly structured HTML to a massive soup of unmatched tags. This
made parsing and error-correcting badly-formed HTML markup
expensive to do in Emacs-Lisp — and performance suffered. To add
to this, mainstream users moved away because Emacs' rendering
engine at the time was not rich enough to provide the type of
visual renderings that users had come to expect. The advent of
DHTML, and JavaScript based Web Applications finally killed off
Emacs-W3 as far as most Emacs users were concerned.
</p>

<p>
But Emacs-W3 went through a revival on the emacspeak audio
desktop in late 1999 with the arrival of XSLT, and Daniel
Veillard's excellent implementation via the <b>libxml2</b> and
<b>libxslt</b> packages. With these in hand, Emacspeak was able to
hand-off the bulk of HTML error correction to the <b>xsltproc</b>
tool. The lack of visual fidelity didn't matter much for an
eyes-free environment; so Emacs-W3 continued to be a useful tool
for consuming large amounts of Web content that did not require
JavaScript support.
</p>

<p>
During the last 24 months, <b>libxml2</b> has been built into Emacs;
this means that you can now parse arbitrary HTML as found in the
wild without incurring a performance hit. This functionality was
leveraged first by package <b>shr</b> (Simple HTML Renderer) within
the <b>gnus</b> package for rendering HTML email. Later, the author of
<b>gnus</b> and <b>shr</b> created a new light-weight HTML viewer called
<b>eww</b> that is now part of Emacs 24. With improved support for
variable pitch fonts and image embedding, Emacs is once again
able to provide visual renderings for a large proportion of
text-heavy Web content where it becomes useful for mainstream
Emacs users to view at least some Web content within Emacs;
during the last year, I have added support within emacspeak to
<a href='http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2014/05/emacspeak-eww-updates-for-complete.html'>extend package <b>eww</b></a> with support for DOM filtering and quick
content navigation.

<div class='outline-2' id='outline-container-sec-8'>
<h2 id='sec-8'><span class='section-number-2'>8</span> Audio Formatting —  Generalizing Aural CSS</h2>
<div id='text-8' class='outline-text-2'>
<p>
A key idea in Audio System For Technical Readings <a href='http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/aster/aster-toplevel.html'>(AsTeR)</a> was the
use of various voice properties in combination with non-speech
auditory icons to create rich aural renderings. When I
implemented Emacspeak, I brought over the notion of audio
formatting to all buffers in Emacs by creating a <b>voice-lock</b>
module that paralleled Emacs' <b>font-lock</b> module. The visual
medium is far richer in terms of available fonts and colors as
compared to voice parameters available on TTS engines —
consequently, it did not make sense to directly map Emacs' <b>face</b>
properties to voice parameters. To aid in projecting visual
formatting onto auditory space, I created property <b>personality</b>
analogous to Emacs' <b>face</b> property that could be applied to
content displayed in Emacs; module <b>voice-lock</b> applied that
property appropriately, and the Emacspeak core handled the
details of mapping personality values to the underlying TTS
engine.
</p>

<p>
The values used in property <b>personality</b> were abstract, i.e.,
they were independent of any given speech engine. Later in the
fall of 1995, I re-expressed these set of abstract voice
properties in terms of Aural CSS; the work was published as a
first draft toward the end of 1995, and implemented in Emacs-W3
in early 1996. Aural CSS was an appendix in the CSS-1.0
specification; later, it graduated to being its own module within
CSS-2.0.
</p>

<p>
Later in 1996, all of Emacs' <b>voice-lock</b> functionality was
re-implemented in terms of Aural CSS; the implementation has
stood the test of time in that as I added support for more TTS
engines, I was able to implement engine-specific mappings of
Aural-CSS values. This meant that the rest of Emacspeak could
define various types of voices for use in specific contexts
without having to worry about individual TTS
engines. Conceptually, property <b>personality</b> can be thought of
as holding an <b>aural display list</b> — various parts of the system
can annotate pieces of text with relevant properties that finally
get rendered in the aggregate. This model also works well with
the notion of Emacs overlays where a moving overlay is used to
temporarily highlight text that has other context-specific
properties applied to it.
</p>


<p>
Audio formatting as implemented in Emacspeak is extremely
effective when working with all types of content ranging from
richly structured mark-up documents (LaTeX, org-mode) and
formatted Web pages to program source code. Perceptually,
switching to audio formatted output feels like switching from a
black-and-white monitor to a rich color display. Today,
Emacspeak's audio formatted output is the only way I can
correctly write <b>else if</b> vs <b>elsif</b> in various programming
languages!

<h2 id='sec-9'><span class='section-number-2'>9</span> Conversational Gestures For The Audio Desktop</h2>
<div id='text-9' class='outline-text-2'>
<p>
By 1996, Emacspeak was the only piece of adaptive technology I
used; in fall of 1995, I had moved to Adobe Systems from DEC
Research to focus on enhancing the Portable Document Format (PDF)
to make PDF content repurposable. Between 1996 and 1998, I was
primarily focused on electronic document formats — I took this
opportunity to step back and evaluate what I had built as an
auditory interface within Emacspeak. This retrospect proved
extremely useful in gaining a sense of perspective and led to
formalizing the high-level concept of <i>Conversational Gestures</i>
and structured browsing/searching as a means of thinking about
user interfaces.
</p>

<p>
By now, Emacspeak was a complete environment — I formalized what
it provided under the moniker <i>Complete Audio Desktop</i>. The fully
integrated user experience allowed me to move forward with
respect to defining interaction models that were highly optimized
to eyes-free interaction — as an example, see how Emacspeak
interfaces with modes like <b>dired</b> (Directory Editor) for
browsing and manipulating the filesystem, or <b>proced</b> (Process
Editor) for browsing and manipulating running processes. Emacs'
integration with <b>ispell</b> for spell checking, as well as its
various completion facilities ranging from minibuffer completion
to other forms of dynamic completion while typing text provided
more opportunities for creating innovative forms of eyes-free
interaction. With respect to what had gone before (and is still
par for the course as far as traditional screen-readers are
concerned), these types of highly dynamic interfaces present a
challenge. For example, consider handling a completion interface
using a screen-reader that is speaking the visual display. There
is a significant challenge in deciding <i>what to speak</i> e.g., when
presented with a list of completions, the currently typed text,
and the default completion, which of these should you speak, and
in what order? The problem gets harder when you consider that the
underlying semantics of these items is generally not available
from examining the visual presentation in a consistent manner. By
having direct access to the underlying information being
presented, Emacspeak had a leg up with respect to addressing the
higher-level question — when you do have access to this
information, how do you present it effectively in an eyes-free
environment? For this and many other cases of dynamic
interaction, a combination of audio formatting, auditory icons,
and the ability to synthesize succinct messages from a
combination of information items — rather than having to forcibly
speak each item as it is rendered visually provided for highly
efficient eyes-free interaction.
</p>


<p>
This was also when I stepped back to build out Emacspeak's table
browsing facilities — see the online Emacspeak documentation for
details on Emacspeak's table browsing functionality which
continues to remain one of the richest collection of end-user
affordances for working with two-dimensional data.
</p>

<h3 id='sec-9-1'><span class='section-number-3'>9.1</span> Speech-Enabling Interactive Games</h3>
<div id='text-9-1' class='outline-text-3'>
<p>
So in 1997, I went the next step in asking — given access to the
underlying infromation, is it possible to build effective
eyes-free interaction to highly interactive tasks? I picked
<b>Tetris</b> as a means of exploring this space, the result was an
Emacspeak extension to speech-enable module <b>tetris.el</b>. The
details of what was learned were published as a paper in Assets
98, and expanded as a chapter on Conversational Gestures in my
book on Auditory Interfaces; that book was in a sense a
culmination of stepping back and gaining a sense of perspective
of what I had build during this period. The work on
Conversational Gestures also helped in formalizing the abstract
user interface layer that formed part of the
<a href='http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/'>XForms</a> work at the W3C.
</p>

<p>
Speech-enabling games for effective eyes-free interaction has
proven highly educational. Interactive games are typically built
to challenge the user, and if the eyes-free interface is
inefficient, you just wont play the game — contrast this with a
task that you <b>must</b> perform, where you're likely to make do with
a sub-optimal interface. Over the years, Emacspeak has come to
include eyes-free interfaces to several games including <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris'>Tetris</a>,
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)'>Sudoku</a>, and of late the popular <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)'>2048 game</a>. Each of these have in
turn contributed to enhancing the interaction model in Emacspeak,
and those innovations typically make their way to the rest of the
environment.

<h2 id='sec-10'><span class='section-number-2'>10</span> Accessing Media Streams</h2>
<div id='text-10' class='outline-text-2'>
<p>
Streaming real-time audio on the Internet became a reality with
the advent of RealAudio in 1995; soon there were a large number
of media streams available on the Internet ranging from music
streams to live radio stations. But there was an interesting
twist — for the most part, all of these media streams expected
one to look at the screen, even though the primary content was
purely audio (streaming video hadn't arrived yet!). Starting in
1996, Emacspeak started including a variety of eyes-free
front-ends for accessing media streams. Initially, this was
achieved by building a wrapper around <b>trplayer</b> — a headless
version of RealPlayer; later I built Emacspeak module
<b>emacspeak-m-player</b> for interfacing with package <b>mplayer</b>. A
key aspect of streaming media integration in emacspeak is that
one can launch and control streams without ever switching away
from one's primary task; thus, you can continue to type email or
edit code while seamlessly launching and controlling media
streams. Over the years, Emacspeak has come to integrate with
Emacs packages like <b>emms</b> as well as providing wrappers for
<b>mplayer</b> and <b>alsaplayer</b> — collectively, these let you
efficiently launch all types of media streams, including
streaming video, without having to explicitly switch context.
</p>


<p>
In the mid-90's, Emacspeak started including a directory of media
links to some of the more popular radio stations — primarily as a
means of helping users getting started — Emacs' ability to
rapidly complete directory and file-names turned out to be the
most effective means of quickly launching everything from
streaming radio stations to audio books. And even better — as the
Emacs community develops better and smarter ways of navigating
the filesystem using completions, e.g., package <b>ido</b>, these
types of actions become even more efficient!

<div id='text-11' class='outline-text-2'>
<p>
AsTeR — was motivated by the increasing availability of technical
material as online electronic documents. While AsTeR processed
the TeX family of markup languages, more general ebooks came in a
wide range of formats, ranging from plain text generated from
various underlying file formats to structured EBooks, with
Project <a href='http://www.gutenberg.org/'>Gutenberg</a> leading the way. During the mid-90's, I had
access to a wide range of electronic materials from sources such
as O'Reilly Publishing and various electronic journals — The Perl
Journal (TPJ) is one that I still remember fondly.
</p>

<p>
Emacspeak provided fairly light-weight but efficient access to
all of the electronic books I had on my local disk — Emacs'
strengths with respect to browsing textual documents meant that I
needed to build little that was specific to Emacspeak. The late
90's saw the arival of Daisy as an XML-based format for
accessible electronic books. The last decade has seen the rapid
convergence to <b>epub</b> as a distribution format of choice for
electronic books. Emacspeak provides interaction modes that make
organizing, searching and reading these materials on the
Emacspeak Audio Desktop a pleasant experience. Emacspeak also
provides an OCR-Mode — this enables one to call out to an
external OCR program and read the content efficiently.
</p>

<p>
The somewhat informal process used by publishers like O'Reilly to
make technical material available to users with print impairments
was later formalized by <a href='https://www.bookshare.org/'>BookShare</a> — today, qualified users can
obtain a large number of books and periodicals initially as
Daisy-3 and increasingly as <b>EPub</b>. BookShare provides a RESTful
API for searching and downloading books; Emacspeak module
<b>emacspeak-bookshare</b> implements this API to create a client for
browsing the BookShare library, downloading and organizing books
locally, and an integrated ebook reading mode to round off the
experience.
</p>

<p>
A useful complement to this suite of tools is the Calibre package
for organizing ones ebook collection; Emacspeak now implements an
<b>EPub Interaction</b> mode that leverages Calibre (actually sqlite3)
to search and browse books, along with an integrated <b>EPub mode</b>
for reading books.

<div id='text-12' class='outline-text-2'>
<p>
The ability to invoke external processes and interface with them
via a simple read-eval-loop (REPL) is perhaps one of Emacs'
strongest extension points. This means that a wide variety of
computational tools become immediately available for embedding
within the Emacs environment — a facility that has been widely
exploited by the Emacs community. Over the years, Emacspeak has
leveraged many of these facilities to provide a well-integrated
auditory interface.
</p>

<p>
Starting from a tight code, eval, test form of iterative
programming as encouraged by Lisp. Applied to languages like
Python and Ruby to explorative computational tools such as R for
data analysis and SQL for database interaction, the Emacspeak
Audio Desktop has come to encompass a collection of rich
computational tools that provide an efficient eyes-free
experience.
</p>


<p>
In this context, module <b>ein</b> — Emacs IPython Notebooks —
provides another excellent example of an Emacs tool that helps
interface seamlessly with others in the technical domain. IPython
Notebooks provide an easy means of reaching a large audience when
publishing technical material with interactive computational
content; module <b>ein</b> brings the power and convenience of Emacs '
editting facilities when developing the content. Speech-enabling
package <b>ein</b> is a major win since editting program source code
in an eyes-free environment is far smoother in Emacs than in a
browser-based editor.

<div id='text-13' class='outline-text-2'>
<p>
The ability to process large amounts of email and electronic news
has always been a feature of Emacs. I started using package <b>vm</b>
for email in 1990, along with <b>gnus</b> for Usenet access many years
before developing Emacspeak. So these were the first major
packages that Emacspeak speech-enabled. Being able to access the
underlying data structures used to visually render email messages
and Usenet articles enabled Emacspeak to produce rich, succinct
auditory output — this vastly increased my ability to consume and
organize large amounts of information. Toward the turn of the
century, instant messaging arrived in the mainstream — package
<b>tnt</b> provided an Emacs implementation of a chat client that
could communicate with users on the then popular AOL Instant
Messenger platform. At the time, I worked at IBM Research, and
inspired by package <b>tnt</b>, I created an Emacs client called
<b>ChatterBox</b> using the Lotus Sametime API — this enabled me to
communicate with colleagues at work from the comfort of
Emacs. Packages like <b>vm</b>, <b>gnus</b>, <b>tnt</b> and <b>ChatterBox</b> provide
an interesting example of how availability of a clean underlying
API to a specific service or content stream can encourage the
creation of efficient (and different) user interfaces. The
touchstone of such successful implementations is a simple test —
can the user of a specific interface tell if the person whom he
is communicating with is also using the same interface? In each
of the examples enumerated above, a user at one end of the
communication chain cannot tell, and in fact shouldn't be able to
tell what client the user at the other end is using. Contrast
this with closed services that have an inherent <i>lock-in</i> model
e.g., proprietary word processors that use undocumented
serialization formats — for a fun read, see this write-up on
<a href='http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/publications/colored-paper.html'>Universe Of Fancy Colored Paper</a>.
</p>


<p>
Today, my personal choice for instant messaging is the open
Jabber platform. I connect to Jabber via Emacs package
<b>emacs-jabber</b> and with Emacspeak providing a light-weight
wrapper for generating the eyes-free interface, I can communicate
seamlessly with colleagues and friends around the world.
</p>

<p>
As the Web evolved to encompass ever-increasing swathes of
communication functionality that had already been available on
the Internet, we saw the world move from Usenet groups to <b>Blogs</b>
— I remember initially dismissing the blogging phenomenon as just
a re-invention of Usenet in the early days. However, mainstream
users flocked to Blogging, and I later realized that blogging as
a publishing platform brought along interesting features that
made communicating and publishing information <b>much</b> easier. In
2005, I joined Google; during the winter holidays that year, I
implemented a light-weight client for Blogger that became the
start of Emacs package <b>g-client</b> — this package provides Emacs
wrappers for Google services that provide a RESTful API.
</p>

</div>


<div class='outline-2' id='outline-container-sec-14'>
<h2 id='sec-14'><span class='section-number-2'>14</span> The RESTful Web —  Web Wizards And URL Templates For Faster Access</h2>
<div id='text-14' class='outline-text-2'>
<p>
Today, the Web, based on URLs and HTTP-style protocols is widely
recognized as a platform in its own right. This platform emerged
over time — to me, Web APIs arrived in the late 90's when I
observed the following with respect to my own behavior on many
popular sites:
</p>

<ol class='org-ol'>
<li>I opened a Web page that took a while to load (remember,  I
was still using Emacs-W3),
</li>
<li>I then searched through the page to find a form-field that
I filled out, e.g., start and end destinations on Yahoo
Maps,
</li>
<li>I hit <b>submit</b>, and once again waited for a heavy-weight
HTML page to load,
</li>
<li>And finally, I hunted through the rendered content to find
what I was looking for.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
This pattern repeated across a wide-range of interactive Web
sites ranging from AltaVista for search (this was pre-Google),
Yahoo Maps for directions, and Amazon for product searches to
name but a few. So I decided to automate away the pain by
creating Emacspeak module <b>emacspeak-websearch</b> that did the
following:
</p>

<ol class='org-ol'>
<li>Prompt via the minibuffer for the requisite fields,
</li>
<li>Consed up an HTTP GET URL,
</li>
<li>Retrieved this URL,
</li>
<li>And filtered out the specific portion of the HTML  DOM that
held the generated response.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Notice that the above implementation hard-wires the CGI parameter
names used by a given Web application into the code implemented
in module <b>emacspeak-websearch</b>. REST as a design pattern had not
yet been recognized, leave alone formalized, and module
<b>emacspeak-websearch</b> was initially decryed as being fragile.
</p>

<p>
However, over time, the CGI parameter names remained fixed — the
 only things that have required updating in the Emacspeak
 code-base are the content filtering rules that extract the
 response — for popular services, this has averaged about one to
 two times a year.
</p>


<p>
I later codified these filtering rules in terms of XPath, and
also integrated XSLT-based pre-processing of incoming HTML
content before it got handed off to Emacs-W3 — and yes,
Emacs/Advice once again came in handy with respect to injecting
XSLT pre-processing into Emacs-W3!
</p>

<p>
Later, in early 2000, I created companion module
<b>emacspeak-url-templates</b> — partially inspired by Emacs'
<b>webjump</b> module. URL templates in Emacspeak leveraged the
recognized REST interaction pattern to provide a large collection
of Web widgets that could be quickly invoked to provide rapid
access to the right pieces of information on the Web.
</p>

<p>
The final icing on the cake was the arrival of RSS and Atom feeds
and the consequent deep-linking into content-rich sites — this
meant that Emacspeak could provide audio renderings of useful
content without having to deal with complex visual navigation!
While Google Reader existed, Emacspeak provided a light-weight
<b>greader</b> client for managing ones feed subscriptions; with the
demise of Google Reader, I implemented module <b>emacspeak-feeds</b>
for organizing feeds on the Emacspeak desktop. A companion
package <b>emacspeak-webspace</b> implements additional goodies
including a continuously updating ticker of headlines taken from
the user's collection of subscribed feeds.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class='outline-2' id='outline-container-sec-15'>
<h2 id='sec-15'><span class='section-number-2'>15</span> Mashing It Up —  Leveraging Evolving Web APIs</h2>
<div id='text-15' class='outline-text-2'>
<p>
The next step in this evolution came with the arrival of richer
Web APIs — especially ones that defined a clean client/server
separation. In this respect, the world of Web APIs is a somewhat
mixed bag in that many Web sites equate a Web API with a JS-based
API that can be exclusively invoked from within a Web-Browser
run-time. The issue with that type of API binding is that the
only runtime that is supported is a full-blown Web browser; but
the arrival of native mobile apps has actually proven a net
positive in encouraging sites to create a cleaner
separation. Emacspeak has leveraged these APIs to create
Emacspeak front-ends to many useful services, here are a few:
</p>

<ol class='org-ol'>
<li>Minibuffer completion for Google Search using Google Suggest
to provide completions.
</li>
<li>Librivox for browsing  and playing free audio books.
</li>
<li>NPR  for browsing and playing NPR archived programs.
</li>
<li>BBC for playing a wide variety of streaming content
available from the BBC.
</li>
<li>A Google Maps front-end that  provides instantaneous access
to directions and Places search.
</li>
<li>Access to Twitter via package <b>twittering-mode</b>.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
And a lot more than will fit this margin! This is an example of
generalizing the concept of a mashup as seen on the Web with
respect to creating hybrid applications by bringing together a
collection of different Web APIs. Another way to think of such
separation is to view an application as a <b>head</b> and a <b>body</b> —
where the <b>head</b> is a specific user interface, with the <b>body</b>
implementing the application logic. A cleanly defined separation
between the <b>head</b> and <b>body</b> allows one to attach <i>different</i>
user interfaces i.e., <b>heads</b> to the given <b>body</b> without any
loss of functionality, or the need to re-implement the entire
application. Modern platforms like Android enable such separation
via an
<a href='http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html'>Intent</a>
mechanism. The Web platform as originally defined around URLs is
actually well-suited to this type of separation — though the full
potential of this design pattern remains to be fully realized
given today's tight association of the Web to the Web Browser.

<div class='outline-2' id='outline-container-sec-16'>
<h2 id='sec-16'><span class='section-number-2'>16</span> Conclusion</h2>
<div id='text-16' class='outline-text-2'>
<p>
In 1996, I wrote an article entitled
<a href='http://www.drdobbs.com/user-interface-a-means-to-an-end/184410453'>User
Interface — A Means To An End</a> pointing out that the size and
shape of computers were determined by the keyboard and
display. This is even more true in today's world of tablets,
phablets and large-sized phones — with the only difference that
the keyboard has been replaced by a touch screen. The next
generation in the evolution of <b>personal</b> devices is that they
will become truly personal by being wearables — this once again
forces a separation of the user interface peripherals from the
underlying compute engine. Imagine a variety of wearables that
collectively connect to ones cell phone, which itself connects to
the cloud for all its computational and information needs. Such
an environment is rich in possibilities for creating a wide
variety of user experiences to a single underlying body of
information; Eyes-Free interfaces as pioneered by systems like
Emacspeak will come to play an increasingly vital role alongside
visual interaction when this comes to pass.

<a href='http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CompanyMode'>Company</a> — a  flexible <b>complete-anything</b>   extension for Emacs.
Package <i>company</i> gains much of its flexibility by providing an
extensible framework for both back-ends and front-ends; back-ends
are responsible for  language-specific support e.g., <b>C++</b> vs
<b>Emacs Lisp</b>; front-ends can provide different <i>visualizations</i>
of the available completions.
</p>

<p>
I started using package <b>company</b> as I taught myself to program
in <a href='http://golang.org'>Go</a>  over the last couple of weeks, and package
<b>emacspeak-company</b>  was one of the bi-products.
</p>
</div>

<div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-sec-1-1'>
<h3 id='sec-1-1'><span class='section-number-3'>1.1</span> Using Company With Emacspeak</h3>
<div id='text-1-1' class='outline-text-3'>
<p>
You can turn on <i>company-mode</i> in dividual buffers; you can also
turn it on globally. Company comes pre-packaged with backend
support for many programming languages; for programming in Go, I
use module <i>company-go</i> in conjunction with the <a href='http://github.com/nsf/gocode'>GoCode</a> tool.
</p>

<p>
See customization group <i>company</i>  to customize package
<i>company</i>;
Emacspeak loads package <i>emacspeak-company</i>  when package
<i>company</i> is loaded, and that automatically sets up the
<b>Emacspeak</b> front-end.
</p>

<p>
Once activated, package <i>company</i> shows available completions
where available once you type a prescribed number of
characters. Available candidates are displayed visually via an
overlay and can be traversed using either the <span class='underline'>up/down</span> arrows or
keys <span class='underline'>M-n</span> and <span class='underline'>M-p</span>. You can also search and filter the
available completions, see documentation for command
<span class='underline'>company-mode</span>. The available visual front-ends also display
relevant metadata for the current candidate in the echo
area. 
</p>

<p>
Front-end <i>emacspeak-company</i> performs the following additional
actions:
</p>

<ul class='org-ul'>
<li>Speaks current candidate along with the relevant metadata.
</li>
<li>The metadata is spoken using  <span class='underline'>voice-annotate</span>.
</li>
<li>Auditory icon <span class='underline'>help</span> indicates  that  completion has started.
</li>
<li>pressing <span class='underline'>F1</span> during completion displays documentation for
the current candidate.
</li>
<li>You can choose the current candidate by pressing <span class='underline'>RET</span>; this
</li>
</ul>
<p>
speaks the selected candidate.
</p>
<ul class='org-ul'>
<li>Auditory icon <span class='underline'>close-object</span> indicates that completion has finished.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='sec-1-2'><span class='section-number-3'>1.2</span> Insights From Speech-Enabling Company</h3>
<div id='text-1-2' class='outline-text-3'>
<p>
Company uses a fluid visual interface to display completions
without the user having to switch contexts — it achieves this by
using overlays that appear briefly in the form of a conceptual
tooltip. These pseudo tooltips are created and destroyed via a
timer; keyboard interaction causes these to be updated —
including hiding the tooltip where appropriate.
</p>

<p>
Module <i>emacspeak-company</i>   speech-enables this interface by
examining the underlying information used to create the
visualization  to produce an effective audio-formatted representation.
The net effect is that you can write code with completion helping
you along the way; you do not need  to switch tasks to lookup
details  as to what completions are available.

              Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all 
              major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular, 
              distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated 
              system without any undue pressure—a documented success for 
              the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system 
              evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at 
              the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak 
              codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform 
              used to develop and distribute the software.

            <p> 
              Extensive studies have shown that thanks to these features, users 
              consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this 
              wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   priceless

            </p> 
 
            <p> 
              At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of 
              eyes-free social interaction and carries forward the 
              well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user 
              interface features that eventually show up in luser environments. 
            </p> 
 
            <p> 
              On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a 
              crash-prone but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion 
              "Emacs is a system from the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak 
              evinced surprise at the unusual candor manifest in the assertion 
              that it would take popular idiot-proven interfaces until the year 
              2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio desktop is 
              today. Industry experts welcomed this refreshing breath of 
              Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time when users are 
              reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) unleashed by 
              complex software systems backed by even more convoluted press

              Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and 
              not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without 
              adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer. These 
              same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped 
              functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of 
              Emacspeak once pointed out that these results re-emphasize the 
              user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is the user –and not the 
              computer– that stops functioning when Emacspeak is uninstalled!".

              Emacspeak 40.0 goes back to Web basics by enabling <a href='http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2013/11/reading-web-content-efficiently.html'>efficient 
              access</a> to large amounts of readable Web content. Emacspeak 39.0 
              continues the Emacspeak tradition of increasing the breadth of 
              user tasks that are covered without introducing unnecessary 
              bloatware. Emacspeak 38.0 is the latest in a series of 
              award-winning releases from Emacspeak Inc. Emacspeak 37.0 
              continues the tradition of delivering robust software as 
              reflected by its code-name. Emacspeak 36.0 enhances the audio 
              desktop with many new tools including full EPub support — hence 
              the name EPubDog. Emacspeak 35.0 is all about teaching a new dog 
              old tricks — and is aptly code-named HeadDog in honor of our 
              new Press/Analyst contact. emacspeak-34.0 (AKA Bubbles) 
              established a new beach-head with respect to rapid task 
              completion in an eyes-free environment. Emacspeak-33.0 AKA 
              StarDog brings unparalleled cloud access to the audio 
              desktop. Emacspeak 32.0 AKA LuckyDog continues to innovate via 
              open technologies for better access. Emacspeak 31.0 AKA TweetDog 
              — adds tweeting to the Emacspeak desktop. Emacspeak 30.0 AKA 
              SocialDog brings the Social Web to the audio desktop—you cant but 
              be social if you speak! Emacspeak 29.0—AKAAbleDog—is a testament 
              to the resilliance and innovation embodied by Open Source 
              software—it would not exist without the thriving Emacs community 
              that continues to ensure that Emacs remains one of the premier 
              user environments despite perhaps also being one of the 
              oldest. Emacspeak 28.0—AKA PuppyDog—exemplifies the rapid pace of 
              development evinced by Open Source software. Emacspeak 27.0—AKA 
              FastDog—is the latest in a sequence of upgrades that make 
              previous releases obsolete and downgrades unnecessary. Emacspeak 
              26—AKA LeadDog—continues the tradition of introducing innovative 
              access solutions that are unfettered by the constraints inherent 
              in traditional adaptive technologies. Emacspeak 25 —AKA ActiveDog 
              —re-activates open, unfettered access to online 
              information. Emacspeak-Alive —AKA LiveDog —enlivens open, 
              unfettered information access with a series of live updates that 
              once again demonstrate the power and agility of open source 
              software development. Emacspeak 23.0 – AKA Retriever—went the 
              extra mile in fetching full access. Emacspeak 22.0 —AKA GuideDog 
              —helps users navigate the Web more effectively than ever 
              before. Emacspeak 21.0 —AKA PlayDog —continued the Emacspeak 
              tradition of relying on enhanced productivity to liberate 
              users. Emacspeak-20.0 —AKA LeapDog —continues the long 
              established GNU/Emacs tradition of integrated innovation to 
              create a pleasurable computing environment for eyes-free 
              interaction. emacspeak-19.0 –AKA WorkDog– is designed to 
              enhance user productivity at work and leisure. Emacspeak-18.0 
              –code named GoodDog– continued the Emacspeak tradition of 
              enhancing user productivity and thereby reducing total cost of 
              ownership. Emacspeak-17.0 –code named HappyDog– enhances user 
              productivity by exploiting today's evolving WWW 
              standards. Emacspeak-16.0 –code named CleverDog– the follow-up 
              to SmartDog– continued the tradition of working better, faster, 
              smarter. Emacspeak-15.0 –code named SmartDog–followed up on 
              TopDog as the next in a continuing a series of award-winning 
              audio desktop releases from Emacspeak Inc. Emacspeak-14.0 –code 
              named TopDog–was the first release of this 
              millennium. Emacspeak-13.0 –codenamed YellowLab– was the 
              closing release of the 20th. century. Emacspeak-12.0 –code named 
              GoldenDog– began leveraging the evolving semantic WWW to provide 
              task-oriented speech access to Webformation. Emacspeak-11.0 
              –code named Aster– went the final step in making Linux a 
              zero-cost Internet access solution for blind and visually 
              impaired users. Emacspeak-10.0 –(AKA Emacspeak-2000) code named 
              WonderDog– continued the tradition of award-winning software 
              releases designed to make eyes-free computing a productive and 
              pleasurable experience. Emacspeak-9.0 –(AKA Emacspeak 99) code 
              named BlackLab– continued to innovate in the areas of speech 
              interaction and interactive accessibility. Emacspeak-8.0 –(AKA 
              Emacspeak-98++) code named BlackDog– was a major upgrade to the 
              speech output extension to Emacs. 
            </p> 
 
            <p> 
              Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released as OpenSource on 
              the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech interface 
              to UNIX workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code 
              named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant 
              enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went 
              further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98 
              integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio desktop 
              to provide the first fully interactive speech-enabled WebTop.

<p>
Within a few weeks, <a href='http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2013/11/reading-web-content-efficiently.html'>EWW</a> has become my prefered way of consuming
large amounts of Web content — except for simple fill-out
forms, it has entirely replaced Emacs/W3 for me. Goes without
saying that I still use ChromeVox for Js-heavy Web sites.
</p>

<p>
This article summarizes  some of the major enhancements to EWW
implemented in module <span class='underline'>emacspeak-eww</span>; See the online
documentation and key-binding help for complete details.
</p>

<h3 id='sec-1-1'><span class='section-number-3'>1.1</span> EWW And Masquerade Mode</h3>
<div id='text-1-1' class='outline-text-3'>
<p>
You can now have EWW masquerade as modern  browsers; note that
some sites might serve you more feature-rich content in this
mode. 
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-sec-1-2'>
<h3 id='sec-1-2'><span class='section-number-3'>1.2</span> Smart Google Searches</h3>
<div id='text-1-2' class='outline-text-3'>
<p>
All of the features from module <span class='underline'>emacspeak-google</span> have been
integrated to work with EWW. In addition, if running in
masquerade-mode, you can quickly access knowledge cards if
available on the current results page.
</p>

<div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-sec-1-3'>
<h3 id='sec-1-3'><span class='section-number-3'>1.3</span> Rich DOM  Filtering</h3>
<div id='text-1-3' class='outline-text-3'>
<p>
The suite of DOM filtered views has been enhanced to support
filtering by class, id, role, or element-list.  In addition, you
can also invert these filters.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-sec-1-4'>
<h3 id='sec-1-4'><span class='section-number-3'>1.4</span> Structure Navigation</h3>
<div id='text-1-4' class='outline-text-3'>
<p>
Emacspeak now supports structured navigation in pages rendered by
EWW, see the key-bindings for details.

<h3 id='sec-1-5'><span class='section-number-3'>1.5</span> Integration With URL-Templates And Feeds</h3>
<div id='text-1-5' class='outline-text-3'>
<p>
EWW is now fully integrated with Emacspeak WebSearch,
URL-Templates and Feeds. This means that hitting <span class='underline'>g</span> in an EWW
buffer does the <i>right thing</i> with respect to updating the
rendered buffer:
</p>

<ul class='org-ul'>
<li>If viewing a feed, the feed is reloaded before it is rendered
as HTML.
</li>
<li>If viewing a url-template, the template is re-opened,
prompting for user-input if needed.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='sec-1-6'><span class='section-number-3'>1.6</span> XSLT Integration</h3>
<div id='text-1-6' class='outline-text-3'>
<p>
Most of the functionality provided by module <span class='underline'>emacspeak-xslt</span> for
filtering the DOM in the world of Emacs/W3 is achieved more
effectively via the DOM  filtering commands in <span class='underline'>emacspeak-eww</span>
—that said, XSLT pre-processing is fully integrated with EWW via
supporting modules <span class='underline'>emacspeak-ew</span> and <span class='underline'>emacspeak-webutils</span>.

<div id='text-1-7' class='outline-text-3'>
<p>
Here are some more fun things that might be worth doing:
</p>

<ul class='org-ul'>
<li>Integrate <a href='http://phantomjs.org/'>PhantomJS</a> with EWW  to load content that is
rendered via JS <span class='underline'>document.write</span>.
</li>
<li>Integrate with  <a href='http://casperjs.org/./index.html'>CasperJS</a> to enable interaction with
light-weight WebApps.
</li>
<li>Integrate with Chrome over the debugger API to access the
live DOM  within Chrome.
</li>
</ul>

Module Emacspeak-Webspace provides a rolling ticker of 
information  that is automatically retrieved, cached and 
maintained by Emacspeak.  Using this functionality, you can set 
up specific buffers to have <i>interesting</i> tidbits of information 
displayed automatically in the header-line; Emacspeak speaks 
these items of information as you switch contexts. This article

<li>You can quickly glance at something while switching contexts, 
and ignore it if it is not important. 
</li> 
<li>The object that you <i>glance</i> at while switching contexts does 
not become an object of attention ie, the casual task remains 
casual, as opposed to becoming the primary task.  Email is 
the antithesis to this model — where if you start glancing 
at email, it's a sufficiently strong distraction that you'll 
start doing email  — as opposed to what you were supposed 
to be doing. 
</li> 
<li>If the item you glanced at deserves further attention, you 
can come back to it later — and the system gives you 
sufficient confidence in your ability to come back to it 
later — note that this is <b>essential</b> to ensure the 
previous  requirement. 
</li> 
<li>Items  are cached  but get pushed out by newer items — this 
makes sure you dont feel pressured to <i>read everything</i> or 
have to explicitly <i>catch-up</i> — in prior systems including 
email and Google Reader, I always found the task of hitting 
<i>catch-up</i> without reading everything  a fairly stressful experience.

<li>Applied to information updates, think <i>hallway conversations</i> 
outside your office — you mostly ignore them, but sometime 
get drawn because you hear some specific keywords and/or

<h3 id='sec-1-2'><span class='section-number-3'>1.2</span> Early Implementation In 2009</h3> 
<div class='outline-text-3' id='text-1-2'> 
<p> 
I used the WebSpace functionality in Emacspeak for news and 
weather updates starting 2009; at some time in late 2009, I cut 
it over to get updates from my Google Reader stream.  It was 
extremely effective for my usage pattern — I typically 
activated the functionality in all shell buffers. In my work 
style where I switch among the primary tasks of engineering 
(writing/reviewing  code), writing/reviewing design documents, 
and doing email to facilitate the previous two tasks, the shell 
buffer is where I switch to while context-switching e.g., 
launching a build after writing code as an example.  Having the 
Webspace functionality say <i>something interesting</i> at those times 
was optimal.

<div class='outline-text-3' id='text-1-3'> 
<p> 
The information to be pulled in the rolling header line is pulled 
from a cache — in 2009, this cache was populated from my Google 
Reader stream. The cache was maintained in a ring with older 
items falling off the end.  You could optionally switch to a 
buffer displaying all of the currently cached items — this 
functionality assured me that  I could always later find an item 
that  had caught my attention while  I was in the process of 
context switching amongst tasks. Notice that if I didn't go back 
and check for that item within a day, it would fall off the 
ring-buffer cache — and this usually would mean that it likely 
wasn't that important after all.

<div class='outline-text-3' id='text-1-4'> 
<p> 
With the passing of Google Reader last year, I started 
implementing the feed-reading functionality I needed in Emacspeak 
independent of Google Reader; see the earlier article in this 
blog titled <a href='http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2013/12/managing-and-accessing-feeds-on.html'>Managing And Accessing Feeds On The Emacspeak Audio 
Desktop</a>. 
Next, I updated the Emacspeak WebSpace functionality to build its 
cache from the set of feeds in <span class='underline'>emacspeak<sub>feeds</sub></span>.

</div> 
</div> 
<div id='outline-container-sec-1-5' class='outline-3'> 
<h3 id='sec-1-5'><span class='section-number-3'>1.5</span> Usage Pattern</h3> 
<div class='outline-text-3' id='text-1-5'> 
<p> 
This section details my own usage pattern and set-up — this is 
by no means the only way to use this functionality. 
</p> 
<ol class='org-ol'> 
<li>Emacspeak binds Webspace functionality to  <span class='underline'>Hyper Space</span>  as 
a prefix key. 
</li> 
<li><span class='underline'>Hyper Space h</span> invokes command 
<span class='underline'>emacspeak-webspace-headlines</span>  — this command 
initializes the feed-store cache, and sets up the 
header-line in the current buffer to display a rolling 
ticker.  Note that you can invoke this command in multiple 
buffers;  those buffers will share a common headlines cache. 
</li> 
<li>The feed-store is updated during Emacs idle-time; I often 
invoke  the elisp form 
<span class='underline'>(emacspeak-webspace-headlines-populate)</span> to populate the 
cache initially. Note that depending on your network, and 
the number of feeds you have in <span class='underline'>emacspeak-feeds</span>, this can 
block emacs for a couple of minutes. 
</li> 
<li>Command <span class='underline'>emacspeak-webspace-headlines-browse</span>  displays an 
interactive buffer containing the current set  of cached 
headlines — this is where you go to track down a headline 
you heard in passing. I bind this to <span class='underline'>Super h</span> by 
customizing <span class='underline'>emacspeak-super-keys</span>. 
</li> 
<li>You can set up other types of information in your rolling 
header — something I initially used it for was weather 
— see command  <span class='underline'>emacspeak-webspace-weather</span>   personally, 
I 've not found this as useful in CA given how consistently 
good the weather is here. 
</li> 
<li>For related work in Emacs, see Emacs package <span class='underline'>newsticker</span>. 
That package works well with Emacspeak, but in using it 
earlier, I found that I could not prevent myself from 
starting to read content i.e., it failed to meet the 
<i>glance and continue</i> requirement.

<div id='text-1' class='outline-text-2'>
<p>
Emacs package GNUS provides a very efficient interface for
consuming large amounts of email.
You can access GMail using GNUS' IMap interface, for my own
configuration for doing this, see file <span class='underline'>tvr/gnus-prepare.el</span> in
the Emacspeak SVN  repository.
Module <span class='underline'>gm-nnir.el</span>  in package <span class='underline'>g-client</span> implements some
convenience hooks to enable efficient searching of GMail. Module
<span class='underline'>emacspeak-gnus</span> has been updated to bind commands from module
<span class='underline'>gm-nnir.el</span> to <span class='underline'>?</span> and <span class='underline'>/</span> in  the <b>Group</b> buffer.

<h3 id='sec-1-1'><span class='section-number-3'>1.1</span> Basic Usage</h3>
<div id='text-1-1' class='outline-text-3'>
<p>
Assuming you already have GNUS configured to read GMail via IMap,
you can:
</p>

<ul class='org-ul'>
<li>Press <span class='underline'>/</span> in the  groups buffer  to search your mail. This
command accepts all GMail queries, so for example,
</li>
</ul>
<pre class='example'>
after: 2014/02/01 to: me
</pre>
<p>
Will find all messages received after   February 1, 2014 and
addressed to you.
</p>
<pre class='example'>
label: foo after: 2014/01/01
</pre>
<p>
Will find messages with label <span class='underline'>foo</span> and received after January
1, 2014.
</p>
<ul class='org-ul'>
<li>Press <span class='underline'>?</span> in the Group buffer to execute a more extensive
search command; this accepts both IMap query specifications
(per RFC 3501) as well as GMail query specifications. The
command provides smart completion, follow the prompts  to
build up complex queries. In general, there is almost
nothing you cannot do with the GMail query language, so this
command is mostly there as a backup.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='sec-1-2'><span class='section-number-3'>1.2</span> The Technical Details</h3>
<div id='text-1-2' class='outline-text-3'>
<p>
The GMail query language is exposed to IMap via custom search key
<span class='underline'>X-GM-RAW</span>; commands <span class='underline'>gm-nnir-group-make-gmail-group</span> and
<span class='underline'>gm-nnir-group-make-nnir-group</span> use this functionality to
construct <i>ephemeral</i> groups that hold the search results.

<p>
The BBC offers a wealth of audio content from both domestic BBC
Radio as well as BBC World Service.
Much of this content is available as Podcasts for a week after it
has been broadcast; in some instances, content is archived and
available for more than a week.
</p>


<p>
The  primary gateway to this content is BBC IPlayer. In
addition, one can subscribe to RSS feeds for BBC Podcasts.

<div id='text-1-3' class='outline-text-3'>
<p>
Here are some of the tools I  use on the Emacspeak desktop to
quickly find and access content from the BBC:
</p>

<ul class='org-ul'>
<li>The BBC publishes a continuously updated directory of 
 RSS feeds; Emacspeak url template  <b>BBC Podcast Directory</b>
can be used to open this directory of feeds.
</li>
<li>With the above directory of feeds at hand, it is easy to
subscribe to oft-accessed feeds via <b>emacspeak-feeds</b> — see
<a href='http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2013/12/managing-and-accessing-feeds-on.html'>Managing And Accessing Feeds</a>.
</li>
<li>In addition to the directory of feeds covered above, the BBC
publishes a detailed program guide as XML; Emacspeak url
template <b>BBC  Program Guide</b> accesses the program guide.
</li>
<li>The program guide described above gives access to RSS feeds
for both current programs as 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
  well as past archives. The program guide is a wealth of
information that makes all the information available in one
location, unlike the BBC IPlayer site.
</p>
<ul class='org-ul'>
<li>A note for UK users; the program guide above is presently set
up to  only show content that is available world-wide; if
you're in the UK, you may want to remove the test for

<pre class='example'>
region='all'
</pre>
<p>
in the XSL  stylesheet  emacspeak/xsl/bbc-ppg.xsl.
</p>
<ul class='org-ul'>
<li>You can find the <a href='http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/ppg.xml'>XML feed</a> for the BBC Program Guide, as well
as the associated <a href='http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/ppg.xsd'>XML Schema</a> definition on the BBC's Web
site.
</li>
<li>Finally, you can access the BBC IPlayer page for any given
BBC channel via Emacspeak url template <b>BBC IPlayer</b>.

<p>
Feature <b>emacspeak-feeds</b> enables rapid access to managing and
accessing Atom, RSS and OPML feeds. Feeds can be browsed from a
dedicated buffer, or accessed via minibuffer completion for
oft-accessed feeds. Feeds are stored as a user customizable
option, and can be added and deleted either via Emacs' customize
interface or directly via interactive Emacs commands.

<h3 id='sec-1-2'><span class='section-number-3'>1.2</span> How It Works</h3>
<div id='text-1-2' class='outline-text-3'>
<p>
The list of subscribed feeds is stored in variable
<span class='underline'>emacspeak-feeds</span> which is managed via Emacs' <span class='underline'>customize</span>
interface. Each entry this list contains a label for the feed,
the feed URL, and the type of the feed (<sub>rss</sub>_, <span class='underline'>atom</span>, or
<span class='underline'>opml</span>).
</p>

<p>
Interactive command  <span class='underline'>emacspeak-webspace-feed-reader</span> opens a
buffer containing the list of subscribed feeds; feeds can be
opened by pressing <span class='underline'>enter</span> on the relevant feed. 
</p>

<p>
Oft-accessed feeds can be opened directly via command
<span class='underline'>emacspeak-feed-browse</span> bound to <span class='underline'>C-e C-u</span> — this command prompts
for a feed label with minibuffer completion.
</p>

<p>
Feeds can be added or deleted by customizing <span class='underline'>emacspeak-feeds</span>
via Emacs' <span class='underline'>M-x customize-variable</span> — bound by default in
emacspeak to <span class='underline'>C-h V</span>. Alternatively, interactive command
<span class='underline'>emacspeak-feed-add-feed</span> bound to <span class='underline'>C-e M-u</span> can be used to
subscribe to feeds. Note that both methods result in the
subscribed feed being stored in <span class='underline'>emacspeak-feeds</span>.

I still find reading Web content in emacs to be way more
efficient than in modern browsers like Chrome with ChromeVox
enabled.
Chrome+ChromeVox is what I use for rich Web Applications;
but when it comes down to reading straight content ranging from
technical documentation to news and current affairs, I find that
I can read a lot more content in a fixed amount of time with
Emacs+Emacspeak than I can with the Chrome+ChromeVox combination.

<h3 id='sec-1-2'><span class='section-number-3'>1.2</span> Welcome EWW: Emacs Web Wowser</h3>
<div id='text-1-2' class='outline-text-3'>


<p>
The author of GNUS recently added package 
EWW (Emacs Web Wowser) to The Emacs repository  — 
 see his
<a href='http://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/2013/06/eww.html'>announcement</a>.
Emacspeak 37.0 included a small addition called <i>shr-url</i> that
leveraged his earlier <i>shr</i> package; I've now added support for
EWW in the Emacspeak source tree. Note that EWW is in the Emacs
source tree, i.e. it will be part of Emacs 24.4, but you can use
it now if you build your own version of Emacs, or obtain an
Emacs that is build from the Emacs source repository.
</p>
<p>
EWW and SHR are interesting because they both leverage
<i>libxml2</i> to parse the incoming HTML. This is way faster than
the native elisp browsing used in Emacs/W3. In my personal
opinion, it also opens up more possibilities than Emacs/W3M with
respect to manipulating and filtering content from elisp ---
something that helps create a better reading experience when
using Emacspeak.

<p>
I've mailed out a small patch to package <i>eww</i> that facilitates
implementing such higher-level commands; for now, you can find
that patch in <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>emacspeak/lisp/patches</span> in the Emacspeak svn
repository. With that patch in place, you can do the following to
efficiently filter popular news sites such as the New York Times
(I use <a href='http://mobile.nytimes.com'>http://mobile.nytimes.com</a>) or CNN
(<a href='http://cnn.com'>http://cnn.com</a>). 
</p>
<p>
When visiting these and other content-heavy sites, try:

</dd>
<dt><b>E</b></dt><dd>Filter by elements
</dd>
<dt><b>R</b></dt><dd>Restore original contents

<p>
With several prominent tweeters expanding coverage of
<span style='text-decoration:underline;'>#emacspeak</span>, NASDOG: ESPK has now been consistently trading over
the social net at levels close to that once attained by DogCom
high-fliers—and as of November 2013 is trading at levels close to
that achieved by once better known stocks in the tech sector.

<h3 id='sec-1-2'><span class='section-number-3'>1.2</span> What Is It?</h3>
<div id='text-1-2' class='outline-text-3'>

<p>Emacspeak is a fully functional audio desktop that provides
complete eyes-free access to all major 32 and 64 bit operating
environments. By seamlessly blending live access to all aspects
of the Internet such as Web-surfing, blogging, social computing
and electronic messaging into the audio desktop, Emacspeak
enables speech access to local and remote information with a
consistent and well-integrated user interface. A rich suite of
task-oriented tools provides efficient speech-enabled access to
the evolving service-oriented social Web cloud.

<div id='text-1-4' class='outline-text-3'>



<p>
 Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all
major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,
distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated
system without any undue pressure—a documented success for
the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system
evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at
the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak
codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform
used to develop and distribute the software.
</p>
<p>
Extensive studies have shown that thanks to these features, users
consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this
wide-spread user demand, the present version remains priceless
as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as
previous releases.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of
eyes-free social interaction and carries forward the
well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user
interface features that eventually show up in luser environments.
</p>
<p>
On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a
crash-prone but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion
"Emacs is a system from the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak
evinced surprise at the unusual candor manifest in the assertion
that it would take popular idiot-proven interfaces until the year
2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio desktop is
today. Industry experts welcomed this refreshing breath of
Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time when users are
reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) unleashed by
complex software systems backed by even more convoluted press
releases.

<h3 id='sec-1-5'><span class='section-number-3'>1.5</span> Independent Test Results:</h3>
<div id='text-1-5' class='outline-text-3'>



<p>
Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and
not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without
adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer. These
same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped
functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of
Emacspeak once pointed out that these results re-emphasize the
user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is the user  – and not the
computer –  that stops functioning when Emacspeak is uninstalled!".

enhancing user productivity and thereby reducing total cost of
ownership. Emacspeak-17.0  – code named HappyDog –  enhances user
productivity by exploiting today's evolving WWW
standards. Emacspeak-16.0  – code named CleverDog –  the follow-up
to SmartDog –  continued the tradition of working better, faster,
smarter. Emacspeak-15.0  – code named SmartDog – followed up on
TopDog as the next in a continuing a series of award-winning
audio desktop releases from Emacspeak Inc. Emacspeak-14.0  – code

millennium. Emacspeak-13.0  – codenamed YellowLab –  was the
closing release of the 20th. century. Emacspeak-12.0  – code named
GoldenDog –  began leveraging the evolving semantic WWW to provide
task-oriented speech access to Webformation. Emacspeak-11.0
 – code named Aster –  went the final step in making Linux a
zero-cost Internet access solution for blind and visually
impaired users. Emacspeak-10.0  – (AKA Emacspeak-2000) code named
WonderDog –  continued the tradition of award-winning software
releases designed to make eyes-free computing a productive and

interaction and interactive accessibility. Emacspeak-8.0  – (AKA
Emacspeak-98++) code named BlackDog –  was a major upgrade to the
speech output extension to Emacs.
</p>
<p>
Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released as OpenSource on
the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech interface
to UNIX workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code
named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant
enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went
further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98
integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio desktop
to provide the first fully interactive speech-enabled WebTop.

                Emacspeak 38.0 is the latest in a series of award-winning 
                releases from Emacspeak Inc.  
                Emacspeak 37.0 continues the tradition of delivering robust 
                software as reflected by its code-name. Emacspeak 36.0 enhances 
                the audio desktop with many new tools including full EPub support 
                — hence the name EPubDog. Emacspeak 35.0 is all about teaching 
                a new dog old tricks — and is aptly code-named HeadDog in honor 
                of our new Press/Analyst contact. emacspeak-34.0 (AKA Bubbles) 
                established a new beach-head with respect to rapid task 
                completion in an eyes-free environment. Emacspeak-33.0 AKA 
                StarDog brings unparalleled cloud access to the audio 
                desktop. Emacspeak 32.0 AKA LuckyDog continues to innovate via 
                open technologies for better access. Emacspeak 31.0 AKA TweetDog 
                — adds tweeting to the Emacspeak desktop. Emacspeak 30.0 AKA 
                SocialDog brings the Social Web to the audio desktop—you cant but 
                be social if you speak! Emacspeak 29.0—AKAAbleDog—is a testament 
                to the resilliance and innovation embodied by Open Source 
                software—it would not exist without the thriving Emacs community 
                that continues to ensure that Emacs remains one of the premier 
                user environments despite perhaps also being one of the 
                oldest. Emacspeak 28.0—AKA PuppyDog—exemplifies the rapid pace of 
                development evinced by Open Source software. Emacspeak 27.0—AKA 
                FastDog—is the latest in a sequence of upgrades that make 
                previous releases obsolete and downgrades unnecessary. Emacspeak 
                26—AKA LeadDog—continues the tradition of introducing innovative 
                access solutions that are unfettered by the constraints inherent 
                in traditional adaptive technologies. Emacspeak 25 —AKA ActiveDog 
                —re-activates open, unfettered access to online 
                information. Emacspeak-Alive —AKA LiveDog —enlivens open, 
                unfettered information access with a series of live updates that 
                once again demonstrate the power and agility of open source 
                software development. Emacspeak 23.0 – AKA Retriever—went the 
                extra mile in fetching full access. Emacspeak 22.0 —AKA GuideDog 
                —helps users navigate the Web more effectively than ever 
                before. Emacspeak 21.0 —AKA PlayDog —continued the Emacspeak 
                tradition of relying on enhanced productivity to liberate 
                users. Emacspeak-20.0 —AKA LeapDog —continues the long 
                established GNU/Emacs tradition of integrated innovation to 
                create a pleasurable computing environment for eyes-free 
                interaction. emacspeak-19.0 –AKA WorkDog– is designed to 
                enhance user productivity at work and leisure. Emacspeak-18.0 
                –code named GoodDog– continued the Emacspeak tradition of 
                enhancing user productivity and thereby reducing total cost of 
                ownership. Emacspeak-17.0 –code named HappyDog– enhances user 
                productivity by exploiting today's evolving WWW 
                standards. Emacspeak-16.0 –code named CleverDog– the follow-up 
                to SmartDog– continued the tradition of working better, faster, 
                smarter. Emacspeak-15.0 –code named SmartDog–followed up on 
                TopDog as the next in a continuing a series of award-winning 
                audio desktop releases from Emacspeak Inc. Emacspeak-14.0 –code 
                named TopDog–was the first release of this 
                millennium. Emacspeak-13.0 –codenamed YellowLab– was the 
                closing release of the 20th. century. Emacspeak-12.0 –code named 
                GoldenDog– began leveraging the evolving semantic WWW to provide 
                task-oriented speech access to Webformation. Emacspeak-11.0 
                –code named Aster– went the final step in making Linux a 
                zero-cost Internet access solution for blind and visually 
                impaired users. Emacspeak-10.0 –(AKA Emacspeak-2000) code named 
                WonderDog– continued the tradition of award-winning software 
                releases designed to make eyes-free computing a productive and 
                pleasurable experience. Emacspeak-9.0 –(AKA Emacspeak 99) code 
                named BlackLab– continued to innovate in the areas of speech 
                interaction and interactive accessibility. Emacspeak-8.0 –(AKA 
                Emacspeak-98++) code named BlackDog– was a major upgrade to the 
                speech output extension to Emacs. 
              </p> 
              <p> 
                Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released as OpenSource on 
                the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech interface 
                to UNIX workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code 
                named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant 
                enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went 
                further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98 
                integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio desktop 
                to provide the first fully interactive speech-enabled WebTop.

Module GMaps is now in the Emacspeak svn repository and will be

<p> 
Run command M-x gmaps to bring up the maps interaction buffer. 
This buffer provides many special commands for talking to Google 
Maps –  use <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>C-h b</span> in emacs to get a list of 
key-bindings. Here is a brief summary of how things work: 
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>You can get directions (walking, driving, by cycling, or 
    public transit)  via keystrokes <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>w</span>, <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>d</span>, <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>b</span>, or <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>t</span>. These 
    commands prompt for start and end addresses. 
</li> 
<li>You can set your current location  by hitting <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>c</span>  — ; this 
    will be used for Places Search. 
</li> 
<li>You can specify the radius for Places Search by pressing <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>r</span> 
    and specifying the radius  e.g. <i>500</i> for 500m. 
</li> 
<li>You can set up an optional  filter for your Places Search by pressing <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>f</span>. 
</li> 
<li>Pressing <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>n</span> at this point will show you places in your 
    vicinity that match your filter criteria. 
</li> 
<li>Pressing 'space' on a Place displays details for that place. 
</li> 
<li>Place details when expanded provide buttons that link you to 
    hours-of-business, Web-site for that place, and the place's 
    G+ page if any. 
</li> 
</ul> 
 
 
<p> 
Note that module GMaps replaces the now obsolete Emapspeak 
functionality that has been available on <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>C-e?e</span> since 
early 2005.

<p>
  Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all
major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,
distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated
system without any undue pressure—a documented success for
the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system
evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at
the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak
codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform
used to develop and distribute the software.
</p>
<p>
Extensive studies have shown that thanks to these features, users
consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this
wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   priceless
as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as
previous releases.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of
eyes-free social interaction and carries forward the
well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user
interface features that eventually show up in luser environments.
</p>
<p>
On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a
crash-prone but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion
"Emacs is a system from the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak
evinced surprise at the unusual candor manifest in the assertion
that it would take popular idiot-proven interfaces until the year
2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio desktop is
today. Industry experts welcomed this refreshing breath of
Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time when users are
reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) unleashed by
complex software systems backed by even more convoluted press
releases.

<div id='text-1-6' class='outline-text-3'>



<p>
Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and
not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without
adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer. These
same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped
functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of
Emacspeak once pointed out that these results re-emphasize the
user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is the user –and not the
computer– that stops functioning when Emacspeak is uninstalled!".

<p>Emacspeak 37.0 continues the tradition of delivering robust
software as reflected by its code-name. Emacspeak 36.0 enhances
the audio desktop with many new tools including full EPub support
— hence the name EPubDog. Emacspeak 35.0 is all about teaching
a new dog old tricks — and is aptly code-named HeadDog in honor
of our new Press/Analyst contact. emacspeak-34.0 (AKA Bubbles)
established a new beach-head with respect to rapid task
completion in an eyes-free environment. Emacspeak-33.0 AKA
StarDog brings unparalleled cloud access to the audio
desktop. Emacspeak 32.0 AKA LuckyDog continues to innovate via
open technologies for better access. Emacspeak 31.0 AKA TweetDog
— adds tweeting to the Emacspeak desktop. Emacspeak 30.0 AKA
SocialDog brings the Social Web to the audio desktop—you cant but
be social if you speak! Emacspeak 29.0—AKAAbleDog—is a testament
to the resilliance and innovation embodied by Open Source
software—it would not exist without the thriving Emacs community
that continues to ensure that Emacs remains one of the premier
user environments despite perhaps also being one of the
oldest. Emacspeak 28.0—AKA PuppyDog—exemplifies the rapid pace of
development evinced by Open Source software. Emacspeak 27.0—AKA
FastDog—is the latest in a sequence of upgrades that make
previous releases obsolete and downgrades unnecessary. Emacspeak
26—AKA LeadDog—continues the tradition of introducing innovative
access solutions that are unfettered by the constraints inherent
in traditional adaptive technologies. Emacspeak 25 —AKA ActiveDog
—re-activates open, unfettered access to online
information. Emacspeak-Alive —AKA LiveDog —enlivens open,
unfettered information access with a series of live updates that

—helps users navigate the Web more effectively than ever
before. Emacspeak 21.0 —AKA PlayDog —continued the Emacspeak
tradition of relying on enhanced productivity to liberate
users. Emacspeak-20.0 —AKA LeapDog —continues the long
established GNU/Emacs tradition of integrated innovation to
create a pleasurable computing environment for eyes-free
interaction. emacspeak-19.0 –AKA WorkDog– is designed to
enhance user productivity at work and leisure. Emacspeak-18.0
–code named GoodDog– continued the Emacspeak tradition of
enhancing user productivity and thereby reducing total cost of
ownership. Emacspeak-17.0 –code named HappyDog– enhances user
productivity by exploiting today's evolving WWW
standards. Emacspeak-16.0 –code named CleverDog– the follow-up
to SmartDog– continued the tradition of working better, faster,
smarter. Emacspeak-15.0 –code named SmartDog–followed up on
TopDog as the next in a continuing a series of award-winning
audio desktop releases from Emacspeak Inc. Emacspeak-14.0 –code
named TopDog–was the first release of this
millennium. Emacspeak-13.0 –codenamed YellowLab– was the
closing release of the 20th. century. Emacspeak-12.0 –code named
GoldenDog– began leveraging the evolving semantic WWW to provide
task-oriented speech access to Webformation. Emacspeak-11.0
–code named Aster– went the final step in making Linux a
zero-cost Internet access solution for blind and visually
impaired users. Emacspeak-10.0 –(AKA Emacspeak-2000) code named
WonderDog– continued the tradition of award-winning software
releases designed to make eyes-free computing a productive and
pleasurable experience. Emacspeak-9.0 –(AKA Emacspeak 99) code
named BlackLab– continued to innovate in the areas of speech
interaction and interactive accessibility. Emacspeak-8.0 –(AKA
Emacspeak-98++) code named BlackDog– was a major upgrade to the
speech output extension to Emacs.
</p>
<p>
Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released as OpenSource on
the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech interface
to UNIX workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code
named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant
enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went
further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98
integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio desktop
to provide the first fully interactive speech-enabled WebTop.

<p>
Emacspeak is a fully functional audio desktop that provides
complete eyes-free access to all major 32 and 64 bit operating
environments. By seamlessly blending live access to all aspects
of the Internet such as Web-surfing, blogging, social computing
and electronic messaging into the audio desktop, Emacspeak
enables speech access to local and remote information with a
consistent and well-integrated user interface. A rich suite of
task-oriented tools provides efficient speech-enabled access to
the evolving service-oriented social Web cloud.

<div id='text-1-5' class='outline-text-3'>



<p>
  Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all
major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,
distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated
system without any undue pressure—a documented success for
the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system
evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at
the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak
codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform
used to develop and distribute the software.
</p>
<p>
Extensive studies have shown that thanks to these features, users
consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this
wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   priceless
as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as
previous releases.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of
eyes-free social interaction and carries forward the
well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user
interface features that eventually show up in luser environments.
</p>
<p>
On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a
crash-prone but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion
"Emacs is a system from the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak
evinced surprise at the unusual candor manifest in the assertion
that it would take popular idiot-proven interfaces until the year
2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio desktop is
today. Industry experts welcomed this refreshing breath of
Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time when users are
reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) unleashed by
complex software systems backed by even more convoluted press
releases.

<h3 id='sec-1-6'><span class='section-number-3'>1.6</span> Independent Test Results: </h3>
<div id='text-1-6' class='outline-text-3'>



<p>
Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and
not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without
adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer. These
same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped
functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of
Emacspeak once pointed out that these results re-emphasize the
user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is the user –and not the
computer– that stops functioning when Emacspeak is uninstalled!".

<div id='text-1-8' class='outline-text-3'>

<p>Emacspeak 35.0 is all about teaching a new dog old tricks — and
is aptly code-named HeadDog in honor of our new Press/Analyst
contact. emacspeak-34.0 (AKA Bubbles) established a new
beach-head with respect to rapid task completion in an eyes-free
environment. Emacspeak-33.0 AKA StarDog brings unparalleled cloud
access to the audio desktop. Emacspeak 32.0 AKA LuckyDog
continues to innovate via open technologies for better
access. Emacspeak 31.0 AKA TweetDog — adds tweeting to the
Emacspeak desktop. Emacspeak 30.0 AKA SocialDog brings the Social
Web to the audio desktop—you cant but be social if you speak!
Emacspeak 29.0—AKAAbleDog—is a testament to the resilliance and
innovation embodied by Open Source software—it would not exist
without the thriving Emacs community that continues to ensure
that Emacs remains one of the premier user environments despite
perhaps also being one of the oldest. Emacspeak 28.0—AKA
PuppyDog—exemplifies the rapid pace of development evinced by
Open Source software. Emacspeak 27.0—AKA FastDog—is the latest in
a sequence of upgrades that make previous releases obsolete and
downgrades unnecessary. Emacspeak 26—AKA LeadDog—continues the
tradition of introducing innovative access solutions that are
unfettered by the constraints inherent in traditional adaptive
technologies. Emacspeak 25 —AKA ActiveDog —re-activates open,
unfettered access to online information. Emacspeak-Alive —AKA
LiveDog —enlivens open, unfettered information access with a
series of live updates that once again demonstrate the power and
agility of open source software development. Emacspeak 23.0 --
AKA Retriever—went the extra mile in fetching full
access. Emacspeak 22.0 —AKA GuideDog —helps users navigate the
Web more effectively than ever before. Emacspeak 21.0 —AKA
PlayDog —continued the Emacspeak tradition of relying on enhanced
productivity to liberate users. Emacspeak-20.0 —AKA LeapDog
—continues the long established GNU/Emacs tradition of integrated
innovation to create a pleasurable computing environment for
eyes-free interaction. emacspeak-19.0 –AKA WorkDog– is designed
to enhance user productivity at work and leisure. Emacspeak-18.0
–code named GoodDog– continued the Emacspeak tradition of
enhancing user productivity and thereby reducing total cost of
ownership. Emacspeak-17.0 –code named HappyDog– enhances user
productivity by exploiting today's evolving WWW
standards. Emacspeak-16.0 –code named CleverDog– the follow-up
to SmartDog– continued the tradition of working better, faster,
smarter. Emacspeak-15.0 –code named SmartDog–followed up on
TopDog as the next in a continuing a series of award-winning
audio desktop releases from Emacspeak Inc. Emacspeak-14.0 –code
named TopDog–was the first release of this
millennium. Emacspeak-13.0 –codenamed YellowLab– was the
closing release of the 20th. century. Emacspeak-12.0 –code named
HeadDog– began leveraging the evolving semantic WWW to provide
task-oriented speech access to Webformation. Emacspeak-11.0
–code named Aster– went the final step in making Linux a
zero-cost Internet access solution for blind and visually
impaired users. Emacspeak-10.0 –(AKA Emacspeak-2000) code named
WonderDog– continued the tradition of award-winning software
releases designed to make eyes-free computing a productive and
pleasurable experience. Emacspeak-9.0 –(AKA Emacspeak 99) code
named BlackLab– continued to innovate in the areas of speech
interaction and interactive accessibility. Emacspeak-8.0 –(AKA
Emacspeak-98++) code named BlackDog– was a major upgrade to the
speech output extension to Emacs.
</p>
<p>
Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released as OpenSource on
the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech interface
to UNIX workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code
named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant
enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went
further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98
integrated Internetworking into all aspects of the audio desktop
to provide the first fully interactive speech-enabled WebTop.

<br />
Tilden Labrador, a young, energetic male  yellow Labrador, has
 accepted the position of Press/Analyst contact for Emacspeak
 Inc.   ---  in addition to his primary   responsibility of being
 a  fulltime guide-dog.<br />
Hand-picked from an exclusive pool of high-quality caninedates, Tilden brings
a large and level head to this  position of
responsibility. Tilden grew up in Monroe Ct,  before going to
school at Guiding Eyes For The Blind (GEB), NY.
He graduated from GEB's Action program after excelling at
obstacle avoidance and path planning in Yorktown Heights,
peekskill and White Plains. He rounded out his education with a
one-week practicum  on the Google campus in Mountain View CA.<br />
Tilden brings a fresh perspective to his new job --- he is the
first male Labrador to  take on the role of Emacspeak Inc.'s
press/analyst contact. Asked how he felt about this unique
distinction, he pointed out:<br />
"On the Internet no one knows you're a dog, leave alone what
gender you are".<br />
Tilden promises to steer Emacspeak in a manner that would do
his predecessors <a href="http://emacspeak.sf.net/raman/aster-labrador">Aster
Labrador</a> and <a href="http://emacspeak.sf.net/raman/hubbell-labrador">Hubbell

<p>
Extensive studies have shown that thanks to these features, users
consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this
wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   priceless
as ever—it is being made available at the same zero-cost as
previous releases.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of
eyes-free social interaction and carries forward the
well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user
interface features that eventually show up in luser environments.
</p>
<p>
On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a
crash-prone but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion
"Emacs is a system from the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak
evinced surprise at the unusual candor manifest in the assertion
that it would take popular idiot-proven interfaces until the year
2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio desktop is
today. Industry experts welcomed this refreshing breath of
Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time when users are
reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) unleashed by
complex software systems backed by even more convoluted press
releases.

<div id='text-1.7'>



<p>
Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and
not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without
adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer. These
same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped
functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of
Emacspeak once pointed out that these results re-emphasize the
user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is the user –and not the
computer– that stops functioning when Emacspeak is uninstalled!".

</p>
<p>
Emacspeak-95 (code named Illinois) was released as OpenSource on
the Internet in May 1995 as the first complete speech interface
to UNIX workstations. The subsequent release, Emacspeak-96 (code
named Egypt) made available in May 1996 provided significant
enhancements to the interface. Emacspeak-97 (Tennessee) went
further in providing a true audio desktop. Emacspeak-98

    <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>  
<p>Bookshare recently released a light-weight API that enables  
one to implement custom Bookshare clients. Though Bookshare is  
fully accessible using either Emacs/W3 or Emacs/W3M from within  
the Emacspeak desktop, browser based  interaction often involves  
more clicks than are absolutely necessary to finish the task at  
hand.</p>  
  
<p>Welcome module <em>emacspeak-bookshare</em>, a fully  
integrated Bookshare client for  the Emacspeak desktop.  
Module <em>emacspeak-bookshare</em> provides  a special  
<code>Bookshare Interaction</code> mode  that provides single  
keystroke commands for searching, downloading and viewing  
Bookshare materials from within the comfort of the Emacspeak  
desktop.</p>

<br>   
 <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>   
<p>Speech is silvern --- but silence is golden!   
In the spirit of the above, I just added command   
<code>emacspeak-silence</code> to Emacspeak. You can bind this   
command to your favorite key for silencing all audio output on   
the complete audio desktop --- including any active media   
streams.</p>   
<h2>What This Does</h2>   
   
<p>Command <code>emacspeak-silence</code> stops speech by calling   
<code>dtk-stop</code>. It then runs commands placed on   
<code>emacspeak-silence-hook</code>.   
Each media player defined by Emacspeak  updates hook   
<code>emacspeak-silence-hook</code> with an appropriate action   
that pauses or resumes  that player.</p>   
   
<p>I've also updated the keymaps in   
<code>tvr/console-keymaps</code> to set up the   
<code>windows</code> key on the console to produce   
<code>[silence]</code>, and bound command   
<code>emacspeak-silence</code> to <code>[silence]</code> in   
<code>emacspeak-keymap.el</code>.</p>   
   
<p>   
The net effect is that if you use those console maps, you can   
just hit the <code>windows</code> key whenever you want to   
silence all audio output; pressing it again will resume any media   
streams you had active.</p>   
   
<p>Share And Enjoy --- and here's  wishing our Press/Analyst   
contact a very Happy 13th Birthday --- mark it with a palindromic

Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all 
major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular, 
distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated 
system without any undue pressure  ---  a documented success for 
the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system 
evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at 
the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak 
codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform 
used to develop and distribute the software.

<p>
With several prominent tweeters expanding coverage, NASDOG: ESPK
has now been consistently trading over the net at levels close
to that once attained by DogCom high-fliers  ---  and as of
October 2009 is trading at levels close to that achieved by

<div class='outline-text-3' id='text-1.3'>
<p>
Emacspeak is a fully functional audio desktop that provides
complete eyes-free access to all major 32 and 64 bit operating
environments. By seamlessly blending live access to all aspects
of the Internet such as Web-surfing, blogging, social computing
and electronic messaging into the audio desktop, Emacspeak
enables speech access to local and remote information with a
consistent and well-integrated user interface. A rich suite of
task-oriented tools provides efficient speech-enabled access to
the evolving service-oriented Web cloud.

<div class='outline-text-3' id='text-1.5'>
<p>
Never a toy system, Emacspeak is voluntarily bundled with all
major Linux distributions. Though designed to be modular,
distributors have freely chosen to bundle the fully integrated
system without any undue pressure  ---  a documented success for
the integrated innovation embodied by Emacspeak. As the system
evolves, both upgrades and downgrades continue to be available at
the same zero-cost to all users. The integrity of the Emacspeak
codebase is ensured by the reliable and secure Linux platform
used to develop and distribute the software.
</p>
<p>
Extensive studies have shown that thanks to these features, users
consider Emacspeak to be absolutely priceless. Thanks to this
wide-spread user demand, the present version remains   priceless
as ever  ---  it is being made available at the same zero-cost as
previous releases.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, Emacspeak continues to innovate in the area of
eyes-free social interaction and carries forward the
well-established Open Source tradition of introducing user
interface features that eventually show up in luser environments.
</p>
<p>
On this theme, when once challenged by a proponent of a
crash-prone but well-marketed mousetrap with the assertion
"Emacs is a system from the 70's", the creator of Emacspeak
evinced surprise at the unusual candor manifest in the assertion
that it would take popular idiot-proven interfaces until the year
2070 to catch up to where the Emacspeak audio desktop is
today. Industry experts welcomed this refreshing breath of
Courage Certainty and Clarity (CCC) at a time when users are
reeling from the Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) unleashed by
complex software systems backed by even more convoluted press
releases.

<h3 id='sec-1.6'><span class='section-number-3'>1.6</span> Independent Test Results: </h3>
<div class='outline-text-3' id='text-1.6'>
<p>
Independent test results have proven that unlike some modern (and
not so modern) software, Emacspeak can be safely uninstalled without
adversely affecting the continued performance of the computer. These
same tests also revealed that once uninstalled, the user stopped
functioning altogether. Speaking with Aster Labrador, the creator of
Emacspeak once pointed out that these results re-emphasize the
user-centric design of Emacspeak; "It is the user  -- ;and not the
computer -- ; that stops functioning when Emacspeak is uninstalled!".

<div>
<br>
    <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>Almost exactly 16 years to the date after presenting AsTeR
--- <a href='http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/aster/aster-toplevel.html'>Audio System For Technical Readings</a> --- 
to the CS Faculty at Cornell for my <a href='http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/raman/phd-thesis/index.html'>PhD</a>, I released the source
code as Open Source --- thanks to Prof. David Gries at Cornell
for approving this release.</p>
<p>The sources are checked into GoogleCode project 
<a href='http://aster-math.googlecode.com'>aster-math</a> ---
unfortunately, the name AsTeR was unavailable since there is an
unrelated project of the same name at SourceForge.</p>
<p>So you might well ask: why 16 years later, and why now? The
honest answer is <q>No good reason,</q> except that after
graduating from Cornell, I decided that I would work on  newer
projects, and consequently had no cycles to support the AsTeR
code base. Nothing has changed in that context, nor is it likely
to change in the coming future; however I get requests off and on
from different parts of the Web from teachers and students alike
who have seen my PhD  thesis, played with the demos, and wish to
study the sources.</p>
<h2>What You'll Find In The Sources</h2>
<p>The code has not been actively developed since I finished my
work at Cornell; however, over the years, I 've ensured that the
system starts up and runs on Linux using the Open Source CLisp
environment.
The only text-to-speech engine that is supported is the hardware
DECTalk  --- though it should be a small matter of programming to
support the various Emacspeak speech servers. If you do checkout
the source code, start by looking at the 
<a href='http://aster-math.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/README'>README</a>
file which contains brief instructions on getting started. Feel
free to use the Emacspeak mailing list for now if you wish to
discuss the code --- if the traffic justifies it, we can later
create a project-specific list.</p>

<div>
<br>
    <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>Emacspeak has supported  the  editing  of Unicode text for
over a year now --- thanks to the patches fromLukas.
With the support now mature, I have now retired option
<code>emacspeak-unibyte</code> --- Emacspeak no longer supports
running Emacs in <code>unibyte</code> mode. Note that this aligns
Emacspeak with Emacs 23.2 which obsoletes <code>unibyte</code>
mode.</p>

<p>When you edit text containing Unicode  characters,  
Emacspeak uses the name of  the character as found in the
description file from the Unicode consortium --- you will need to
download and install that data file as documented in Emacs:</p>
<pre>
describe-char-unicodedata-file is a variable defined in `descr-text.el'.
Its value is 
"/usr/local/share/unicode/UnicodeData.txt"

Documentation:
Location of Unicode data file.
This is the UnicodeData.txt file from the Unicode Consortium, used for
diagnostics.  If it is non-nil `describe-char' will print data
looked up from it.  This facility is mostly of use to people doing
multilingual development.

This is a fairly large file, not typically present on GNU systems.
At the time of writing it is at the URL
`http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt'.

You can customize this variable.

This variable was introduced, or its default value was changed, in
version 22.1 of Emacs.

</pre>
<p>With the Unicode data file in place, Emacspeak can announce
names of characters  from <em>all</em> of the world's fonts ---
this includes Braille.
As an added convenience, I have integrated package
<code>toy-braille.el</code> found on the Emacs wiki into the
Emacs codebase and defined a new interactive command
<code>emacspeak-wizards-braille</code> --- if you find yourself
using it often, you can bind it to a key of your choice.
Command <code>emacspeak-wizards-braille</code> prompts for the
string to Braille and produces a Grade-1 representation of  the
specified string using the appropriate Unicode characters.

<div>
<br>
    <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>Over the last couple of years, the TCL world has moved on from
TCL8.3 to TCL8.4 --- this introduces a set of needed
changes to how Emacspeak servers such as Espeak and
ViaVoice-Outloud work.
I have finally decided to break backward compatibility with
TCL8.3 and move things forward to TCL8.4, now that all the Linux
distributions have settled on TCL8.4.</p>
<p>Also, sometime in 2005, I transitioned all of the server
Makefiles to use libtool --- at the time, it made compilation of
the servers somewhat easier.  However, this has tended to make
things more complex over time, thanks to changes in libtool. I've
now dropped the libtool dependency in favor of using simpler
Makefiles --- thanks William Hubbs of Gentoo!</p>

<h3>ViaVoice Outloud Server For Emacspeak</h3>
<p>The Voxin package from Guilles continues to be the easiest
means of obtaining high-quality text-to-speech on Linux.
Installation of that package went smoothly on Hardy; however on
Jaunty, things did not go so well, see notes below for things to
watch out for on Jaunty or later.</p>
<ul>
<li>The libstdc++ compat libraries ended up not getting installed
on Jaunty. Consequence, ViaVoice produces a warning asking you to
install the ViaVoice RTK, even though it's already installed. I
ended up rescueing the compat libs from my Hardy build. Perhaps
we should put up a simple tar.gz file that drops those libs into
/usr/lib?</li>
<li>Alsa is configured to use pulseaudio on Jaunty. 
An unfortunate consequence is that when ViaVoice runs, it sounds
like a stereo channel played as mono, i.e. the speech slows down
and the voice sounds wrong. The fix is to create a  .asoundrc  
file in your home directory --- you can use the sample in
 linux-outloud/ASOUNDRC  as a starting point. To see if
pulseaudio is intervening in your setup, do
:aplay -v  wav file 
--- to see the set of alsa plugins that are participating in
audio output. </li>
</ul>

<h3>ESpeak And Emacspeak</h3>

<p> The ESpeak server does not get affected by the above
problem. However, unless you install package  alsa-oss 
and invoke that server as 
:aoss tcl  espeak 
the server will fail to start if some other application is using
the audio device.</p>

<h3>Software Dectalk And Emacspeak</h3>

<p>This still needs testing under newer Linux distributions ---
I've not used it in a long time and dont have the libs installed
any more.</p>

<div>
<br>
    <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<h2>Launching Oft-Played Media On The Complete Audio Desktop</h2>
<p>Command <code>emacspeak-multimedia</code> lets you launch all
forms of local and remote media. However this stil requires you
to specify the media location --- and this requires a bunch of
keystrokes that you end up repeating for selecting media that you
play often, e.g., from your private music collection. No more
extra keystrokes, you can now have Emacspeak automatically assign
suitable hotkeys for launching <code>emacspeak-media</code> on
your favorite audio collections.</p>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<ul>
<li>Customize Emacspeak option
<code>emacspeak-media-location-bindings</code> using Emacs'
Custom interface:
<pre>
M-x customize-variable --- 
</pre>
press <code>C-H V</code> in emacspeak.
</li>
<li>Click <code>ins</code> to insert a  key/location pair. </li>
<li>Click <code>save</code> to persist the binding.</li>
<li>pressing the assigned hotkey will automatically launch
<code>emacspeak-multimedia</code> on the predefined location ---
emacs will prompt you with regular filename completion for media
resources found in that directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my own case, I have favorites defined on
<code>hyper-&lt;n&gt;</code>  so I can define upto 10 hotkey
assignments  for media  locations.Once launched, Emacspeak
automatically switches to the media player buffer; note that this
is different from how <code>emacspeak-multimedia</code> normally
works. The justification: this hotkey interface is 
ideally suited to remote controls, joysticks, and  any other
peripheral via which you can deliver input to Emacs. </p>

<h2>Abstract: Looking Beyond The Screen</h2>
<div class='outline-2' id='outline-container-1'>
<h2 id='sec-1'>Looking Beyond The Screen</h2>
<div id='text-1'>


<p>
Project <a href='http://eyes-free.googlecode.com'>Eyes-Free</a> aims to enable fluent eyes-free use of mobile
devices running Android. Target uses range from eyes-busy
environments like in-car use to users who are unwilling to or
incapable of looking at the visual display ---  see  <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/business/04blind.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=business'>For The Blind, Technology Does What A Guide Dog Can't</a>, NYTimes, January
4, 2009, for a high-level overview. As described in that article,
we are releasing components from project Eyes-Free as they become
ready for end-user deployment. This announcement marks the first
public release of the <i>eyes-free shell</i> on the Android
Marketplace, though the underlying source code has been available
for some time from the code repository at <a href='http://eyes-free.googlecode.com'>Google Code Hosting</a>.
</p>
<p>
Here is a brief overview of the end-user affordances provided in
this release:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
An <i>Eyes-Free Shell</i> for conveniently launching talking applications.
</li>
<li>
A collection of useful talking applications that turn an
Android phone into an eyes-free communication device  ---  see
subsequent sections for an overview of these
applications. Note that thes eapplications have been written
to be both useful to end-users as well as to help the
developper community to come up to speed with developing
eyes-free applications for Android.

</li>
</ol>

<p>We will be uploading video tutorials demonstrating the use of
these applications to YouTube  ---   please see the project
Web site for these links as they become available.
</p>

</div>

<div class='outline-3' id='outline-container-1.1'>
<h3 id='sec-1.1'>Talking Dialer </h3>
<div id='text-1.1'>


<p>
A key innovation is the use of the touch screen to enable
one-handed, eyes-free dialing of phone numbers using the touch
screen  ---  see Miguel Helft's NY Times article cited above for a good
layman's description of the technique. The talking dialer comes
with a talking phone-book that enables users to quickly select a
desired contact using the touch screen.

<h2>Toward  An Accessible Democracy --- White House Moderator
AxsJAXed!</h2>
<p>This is not directly Emacspeak related --- except that it is
useful for emacspeak users. 
Project AxsJAX, combined with Fire-Vox does for Web-2.0
applications what Emacspeak does for applications written within
Emacs. 
Charles and I just announced <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/accessible/t/5a0c716c9f064b62'>AxsJAX
For White House Moderator</a>
--- an AxsJAX  extension that applies W3C  ARIA  to the <em>White
House Moderator</em>.I'll append the article below:</p>
<div id='outline-container-1' class='outline-2'>
<h2 id='sec-1'>An ARIA  For The White House Moderator</h2>
<div id='text-1'>
<p>
<a href='http://google-axsjax.googlecode.com'>Google-AxsJAX</a> was launched in late 2007 as a library for
access-enabling Web-2.0 applications. 
Since then, we have released accessibility enhancements for many
Web-2.0 applications via the AxsJAX site as early experiments
that have eventually graduated into the products being extended.
Today, we are happy to announce an early AxsJAX  extension  for Google
Moderator that enables fluent eyes-free use of Google Moderator
as seen on the White House site.
</p>
</div>
<div id='outline-container-1.1' class='outline-3'>
<h3 id='sec-1.1'>HowTo: Brief Overview.</h3>
<div id='text-1.1'>
<p>
For details on installing and using AxsJAX extensions, see the
<a href='http://google-axsjax.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/faq.html'>AxsJAX FAQ</a>. Briefly, you need Firefox 3.0 and a screenreader that
supports W3C ARIA. Users who do not have a screenreader installed
can most easily experience the results by installing <a href='http:///www.clcworld.net'>Fire Vox</a>, a
freely available self-voicing extension for Firefox.
</p>
<p>
With the AxsJAX extension in place, you can use Google Moderator
via the keyboard, with all user interaction producing spoken
feedback via W3C ARIA. Here is a brief overview of  the user
experience:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The user interface is divided into  logical panes ---  one
listing topic areas, and the other listing questions in a
given topic. At times, e.g., before a meeting, you may find
an additional <i>Featured Question</i> pane that shows a randomly
selected question that you can vote on.
</li>
<li>
Users can ask new questions under a given topic, or  give a
thumbs-up/down to questions that have already been asked.
</li>
<li>
Use the <u>left</u> and <u>right</u> arrow keys to switch between the two
panes. You hear the  title of  the selected pane as
you switch.
</li>
<li>
Use <u>up</u> and <u>down</u> arrows to navigate among the items in
the selected pane. As you navigate, you hear the current
item.
</li>
<li>
Hit <u>enter</u> to select the current item.
</li>
<li>
The current item can be magnified by repeated presses of the
<u>+</u> (or <u>=</u>) key. To reduce magnification, press the <u>-</u>
key.
</li>
<li>
When navigating the questions in a given topic, hit <u>y</u> or
<u>n</u> to vote a question up or down.
</li>
<li>
When navigating items in the topic pane, hit <u>a</u> to ask a
question. Once you confirm your request to post the
question, it will show up in the list of questions for that
topic so that others can vote that question up or down.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Please use <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/accessible'>Google Group Accessible</a> for providing feedback on 
this AxsJAX extension.

<p>Module <code>emacspeak-webspace</code> has a few new goodies
on offer.
If you activate <em>WebSpace Headlines </em> to obtain a
continuously updating ticker of headlines, you may also at times  
 want to  find one of the headlines you heard go by and
read the relevant article. 
Command  <code>emacspeak-webspace-headlines-view</code> bound by
default to <code>C-RET</code> pops up a special
<em>Headlines</em> buffer that lists all the currently available
headlines. This is a regular Emacs buffer that uses a special 
major mode called  <em>emacspeak-webspace-mode</em>. This mode
provides special commands to open a feed  at point, follow
hyperlinks etc.; use Emacs' online help facilities to learn how
this buffer works.</p>
<p>Mode <em>emacspeak-webspace-mode</em> is also used to
advantage in browsing information retrieved via the Google AJAX
APIs described  in the previous set of articles on this blog.
Google Reader subscribers can now view the subscription list in a
<em>Webspace</em> buffer via command
<code>emacspeak-webspace-reader</code>.
Additionally, command <em>emacspeak-webspace-google</em> provides
a more convenient interface to command
<code>gweb-google-at-point</code> --- in addition to speaking the
snippet from the first search hit, this command places the first
four results in a special <em>Search Results</em> buffer 
that is put in <em>Webspace</em> mode.</p>

<h2>In Praise Of The Google AJAX Search API</h2>
<p>Emacspeak has always provided Google Search with a single
keystroke from anywhere on the audio desktop.
But with the 
coming of the <a href='http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/'>Google AJAX Search API </a>
it becomes possible to integrate Google Search at a far deeper
level into your fingertips!
The AJAX  API demonstrates the true speed of Google Search, since
you dont need to wait for an HTML page to download and render ---
results are served as a light-weight 
<a href='http://json.org/'>JSON</a> data structure.</p>

<h2>What You Can Now Do</h2>

<p>
Module <code>gsearch</code> (part of the <code>g-client</code>
package)
provides an interactive command
<code>gsearch-google-at-point</code> --- I have this bound to key
<code>hyper-/</code> in Emacs.
Executing this command from anywhere inside Emacs does the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grabs word under point, and prompts in the minibuffer for a
search-term --- with the word we just grabbed as the
default.</li>
<li>Fetches other relevant search terms in the background via
Google Suggest, and makes these available via Emacs' minibuffer
history mechanism. Use keys <code>M-n</code> and <code>M-p</code>
to cycle through these if needed.</li>
<li>Hitting <code>ENTER</code> performs a Google Search using the
AJAX API, and displays the  title and content snippet for the
first search result.</li>
<li>Executing command <code>gsearch-google-at-point</code>
subsequently at the same location opens the first search
result.</li>
</ul>
<p>Search And Enjoy!</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
Google is the Web's premier creator of user-friendly Web 2.0
applications, and I have long viewed it as part of our mission to
do for users in the long tail (AKA users with special needs) what
we've achieved for the mainstream user.
 <a href='http://www.abilitynet.org.uk/accessibility2/'>Accessibility 2.0</a> is now a hot topic on the Web
--- and we would like to move from  a world where AJAX
applications were a straight No-No with respect to blind users to
a world where these same technologies are used to enhance their
usability for everyone.
</p>
<p>
<a href='http://code.google.com/p/axsjax'>Google-AxsJAX</a> is an Open Source framework for injecting
accessibility for users with special needs --- and more
generally, usability enhancements --- into Web 2.0 applications.
In this TechTalk, Charles Chen and I  
give a hands-on tutorial on using AxsJAX to enhance the usability
of Web 2.0  applications. The tutorial  covers the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A brief introduction to the additional <i>opcodes</i> introduced
by W3C ARIA  to the assembly language of the Web (AKA HTML+JavaScript).
</li>
<li>
AxsJAX library abstractions built on the above that  help Web
developers generate relevant feedback via the user's adaptive
technology of choice.
</li>
<li>
Steps in creating fluent eyes-free interaction to Web
applications, including enabling rapid access to parts of a
complex Web page.
</li>
</ul>
<p>This tutorial focuses on solutions we've already built and
deployed both within shipping products and as early end-user
experiments. Google products that we will cover include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Google WebSearch
</li>
<li>
Google Reader
</li>
<li>
Google Books
</li>
<li>
GMail and Google Talk
</li>
<li>
Google Scholar
</li>
<li>
Google Sky
</li>
</ul>
<p>And time permitting, we might even demonstrate how I now make up
for all the time I save thanks to   an efficient
eyes-free auditory user interface by playing JawBreaker and
reading XKCD via their AxsJAXed versions. 
</p>
<p>
Note that writing AxsJAX enhancements to Web applications can
help you win <a href='/home/build/google3/javascript/axsjax/THANKS.html'>bragging rights and cool swag</a>! The goal of this
hands-on tutorial is to help you get there faster!

<p>For the last 10 years or so, <em>view-process-mode</em>
has been my task manager of choice for monitoring and controlling

As of Emacs 23, AKA Emacs from CVS, that module does not work
anymore --- in fact it has not been updated for several years.
On the positive side, Emacs now bundles   <em>module ProcEd</em>
--- a task manager that  does for processes what module
<em>DirEd</em> does for files and directories.
As of this morning, <em>proced.el</em> is fully speech-enabled by
Emacspeak.
You can install module <em>ProcEd</em> for Emacs 22 by obtaining

<p><strong>Leveraging Web 2.0 Design Patterns For Enhanced Accessibility</strong>
<em>T. V. Raman (Google)</em>
</p>
<p>
HTML DOM+ JavaScript constitutes the assembly language of Web Applications. Access To Rich Internet Applications --- ARIA --- adds in a couple of additional op-codes for helping Web applications better communicate with adaptive technologies such as screenreaders. How do we now push the envelope with respect
to Web applications and adaptive technologies such as screenreaders and self-voicing browsers in a manner similar to what we as Web developers have collectively achieved for the mainstream user?

This session will demonstrate programming techniques that help Web developers experiment with and build in the latest accessibility techniques into their Web applications. We will base this session on project Google-AxsJAX.

Developers should know JavaScript, but session doesn't require deep AJAX hackery.</p>

<div>
<br>
    <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>I recently upgraded to a Thinkpad X-61 running Gutsy --- 
here  are some brief notes on the move. In summary, all is well,
and I like Gutsy running on the X-61.</p>
<p>Here are things to be aware of both from a hardware and
software perspective. All of this is with X and GNOME  turned
off; note that some of the tips e.g. turning off the display  as
described here, will cause havoc with X.</p>
<ul>
<li>The X-61 display can be turned off using <code>vbetool</code> <br/>
<pre>vbetool dpms off</pre><br/>
for turning off the display, and <br/>
<pre>vbetool dpms on</pre><br/>
for turning it back on again.</li>
<li>If you suspend to memory etc., make sure to add the
appropriate <code>vbetool</code> command to the relevant script
in <code>/etc/acpi/resume.d</code>.</li>
<li>Gutsy is running ALSA 1.0.15, and to date, I've not had any
trouble with the ViaVoice Outloud TTS  engine in this
environment.
Make sure to play with <code>amixer</code> --specifically run
command <br/>
<pre>amixer controls</pre><br/>
to understand all the various switches and controls exposed by
the audio hardware on the X61. 
Here are some of the things that were noticeably different that
are worth mentioning:
<ol>
<li>The PC  speaker can now be manipulated via ALSA.</li>
<li>The X-61 has two input sources. If you plug in an external
mike, make sure to set <em>both</em> input sources   to the
microphone --- as opposed to leaving one or both of them to be
either <code>internal mic</code> or
<code>mix</code>. Specifically, plugging in an external mike
<em>does not</em> disable the internal microphone.</li>
<li>For some bizarre reason, it's possible to turn off the
headphone output--- but you cannot control its gain.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Kernels later than 2.6.21 do much better with respect to
power management, and this really shows on the X-61. With the LCD
off, my X61 claims it'll run for 7.5 hours; if you turn off the
wireless and USB1.1 as well, it claims it can go for over 8.5
hours.</li>
<li>Emacs versions: I'm running out of CVS  AKA Emacs 23--- but
the <code>emacs-snapshot</code> or <code>emacs22</code> Ubuntu
packages appear to mostly work as well.
One irritation with some of the prepackaged  bundles of Emacs
under Ubuntu is that they dont install the Emacs Lisp sources,
and this will bite if you try compiling packages like
Emacs/W3.</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all, the upgrade to Gutsy was mostly painless --- other
than having to figure out the usual nits about the new hardware.
The <code>/proc/acpi/ibm</code> support is further along but not
yet complete--- as an example <code>/proc/acpi/ibm/video </code>
does not yet control the state of the LCD --- and you cannot
query the state of the display reliably through that interface.</p>

<h2>Leveraging The Benefits Of Free Speech!</h2>
<p><strong>For Immediate Release:</strong><br/>
April 1, 2008</p>
<h2>Live From San Jose ... Emacspeak Goes Social!</h2>
<p>Investors and users alike welcomed today's announcement that
Emacspeak (NASDOG:ESPK)
would be going social ---  <em>Going Social is
better than Going Postal</em>!</p>
<p>
As a pioneer in the space of eyes-free information access,
and a firm believer in free speech and free software,
Emacspeak will now help users go social speech-free 
--- all users need do is to use the system. When in use, the
free-social features of Emacspeak will talk to others on your
behalf, answer inane questions, and contribute to the community
by in its turn asking even more inane questions of everyone
else. In a repeat of the <em>network effect</em> that has led to
the resounding success of systems like the World Wide Web and The
Blogosphere,
these viral features in Emacspeak are expected to win ones
running instance many social connections.
The longer one uses these features, the <em>deeper</em>
one's <em>social graph</em>
--- going forward,  the information encapsulated in these social
graphs will be converted to ever-increasing stacks of small
pieces of green paper.</p>
<h2>Coming Soon!</h2> <p>As these features are launched over the
next few weeks, expect Emacspeak generated conversation streams
to show up everywhere ranging from <a href='http://www.twitter.com'>Twitter</a> streams to random email
messages that you can usefully use to forward to spammers. This
innovative approach to communication finally adds value to spam
--- and is being hailed as the next biggest business model to hit
the ether. By making such content available on the Internet, the
system will foster the long term human goal of organizing and
searching all the world's ignorance to make it universally
accessible --- thereby bringing ignorance on par with
knowledge!</p> </div>

<div>
<br>
    <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>A few months ago, I started an Emacspeak module called
<code>emacspeak-webspace</code> that is now ready for wider use.
The goal of this module is to unobtrusively fetch useful
information from the Web and communicate it at  those times that
one is context-switching among tasks.
I gave a talk on user interaction at the last 
<a href='http://www.think.org'>Hackers Conference</a> in
November; in the same session, there was another talk  whose gist
was a plea for <em>less</em> human-computer interaction ---
motivation: User Interfaces are nice, but wouldn't it be nice if
one didn't have to <em>explicitly</em> interact with the machine
to get  information?
The speaker coined the term <em>Zen interfaces</em> in that
context, something that stuck in memory long after the talk.
</p>

<p>I built that thought into module
<code>emacspeak-webspace</code>.
Conceptually, it consists of <em>smart fetchers</em> that fetch
information  asynchronously from the Web, and <em>smart
displayers</em>
that communicate this information at <em>appropriate</em> times.
These are detailed below.
</p>
<h3>Fetchers</h3>
<p>There are two  fetchers  at present:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Weather</dt>
<dd>Fetches current weather conditions for your location.</dd>
<dt>News</dt>
<dd>Fetches headlines from a customizable collection of ATOM and
RSS feeds.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that this module is not intended to be an RSS or ATOM 
feed-reader; for that, use module <code>greader</code> --- an
API-based Google Reader client that is bundled with
Emacspeak.</p>

<h3>Communicating Useful Information Usefully</h3>
<p>With the information in hand, the next question is 
how does one communicate this information <em>usefully</em>, 
and what does <em>at the appropriate time</em> mean? Things to
avoid:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Interaction-Free</dt>
<dd>Do not require explicit user action to hear the
information.</dd>
<dt>Avoid Chatter</dt>
<dd>Avoid creating an auditory user interface that chatters at
the user all the time.</dd>
</dl>

<p>These are conflicting constraints. Notice that in a visual
interface, one can meet the <em>interaction-free</em>
requirement by displaying the information in a  toolbar or
sidebar and allow the user to ignore or absorb the information at
will.</p>
<p>Emacspeak uses Emacs' <em>header-line</em> to display the
continuously updating information.
This meets the <em>interaction-free</em> requirement.
The header line updates every time Emacs updates its display, and
automatically speaking it would produce too much feedback.
But Emacspeak doesn't automatically speak the header-line; it
only speaks it when there is a <em>context-switch</em>.</p>

<h3>How To Use</h3>

<p>Here is how I am using <code>emacspeak-webspace</code> at
present:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Weather</dt>
<dd>Activate weather display in the <code>calendar</code> and
<code>scratch</code> buffers.</dd>
<dt>News</dt>
<dd>Activate feed headlines in selected <code>shell</code>
buffers.</dd>
</dl>
<p>You hear the updated information when switching to buffers
where the webspace display is active.
</p>
<h3>Activating WebSpace Displays</h3>
<p>Webspace displays are activated via the following commands;
all Webspace displays will be  placed by default on prefix key
<code>hyper-space</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>emacspeak-webspace-headlines</code>: <code>hyper-space
h</code></li>
<li><code>emacspeak-webspace-weather</code> <code>hyper-space
w</code></li>
</ul>

<div>
<br>
 <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>This is to announce a new emacspeak module called
<em>Piglets</em> that brings together Emacs and Firefox to create
a powerful framework for authoring Web interaction wizards.</p>
<h2>Why  Piglets?</h2>

<p>You might well ask <q>Why Piglets?</q>,
and might conjecture that <em>PIGLETS</em> might stand for
<strong>Powerful Internet Gadgets for a  Light-Weight  Talking
System</strong>.
You might conjecture that the Emacspeak mascot likes pig-ears; or
you might even  think of attributing it to the fact that my
friend and colleague <a href='http://firevox.clcworld.net'>Charles Chen</a> and creator
of <em> Fire Vox</em> was born in the year of the pig.
But you'd be mostly wrong in all of the above.</p>
<p>Piglets on the Emacspeak desktop are the result of having two
large (and powerful) software pigs connect over a socket. A few
months ago, I blogged here about <em>MozREPL</em> and how it
allows me to  <a href='http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2007/06/firebox-put-fox-in-box.html'>Put
The Fox In A Box</a>. Piglets mark the completion of the
Emacs/Firefox integration that started with Firebox. Once you
install <a href='http://firevox.clcworld.net'>Fire Vox</a>, the
free self-voicing extension for Firefox, piglets become a
versatile means to leverage the self-voicing  Fire-Vox/Firefox DOM from the comfort of
the emacspeak environment.</p>

<h2>What You Need</h2>

<p>Caveat: <strong>ALL</strong> of this is early experimental
software --- and you'll need to tweak things for your environment
to get things working.</p>

<ul>
<li>A version of Emacspeak from the  subversion repository.</li>
<li>Check the installation of the <code>servers/python</code>
files in your Emacspeak installation.</li>
<li>Confirm that the <code>HTTP</code> wrapper for the TTS
servers works. You can most easily do this by running:
<pre>
# Start the HTTPspeech server 
# from emacspeak/servers/python
python HTTPSpeaker.py  outloud 2222 &amp;
# you can replace outloud with dtk-exp
# but the bindings to other TTS  servers is not defined for now
# Run wget to test the speech server:
wget --post-data='speak:hello world' localhost:2222
</pre>
If all is well, you should here the TTS engine say <q>Hello
World</q>
<p><strong>Do not proceed if the above does not
work.</strong></p></li>
<li>Install Fire-Vox and configure it to use the Emacspeak TTS
server.
You can do this with ORCA  providing the feedback.
Alternatively, once you have installed Fire-Vox,  shutdown
Firefox and then edit your
<code>~/.mozilla/firefox/default/prefs.js</code>
<pre>
user_pref("firevox.LastWorkingTTS", 4);
</pre>
</li>
<li>The above sets up Fire-Vox to use the running HTTP speech
server you started earlier.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Loading And Running Piglets</h2>

<p>The Piglets framework is implemented in module
<code>emacspeak-piglets.el</code>. There is a Fire-Vox binding in
module <code>emacspeak-firevox.el</code> and a binding to the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/google-axsjax'>JawBreaker</a>
game in <code>emacspeak-jawbreaker.el</code>.
</p>

<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>

<p>When you get the various pieces configured and working, here
is how things work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Piglets place you in a special interaction buffer in
Emacs.</li>
<li>Typing keys  in this buffer go to Firefox.</li>
<li>Control keys send commands to Firefox using MozREPL.</li>
<li>The latter is most useful in conjunction with Web 2.0
applications that have been <a href='http://code.google.com/p/google-axsjax/'>AxsJAX</a>ed.</li>
<li>Additional commands give access to FireFox features such as
the URL bar. As an example, hit <code>C-w</code>
and type the phrase you'd like to go into the address bar ---
either a URL  or a search term. As an example, try typing
<em>XKCDComic</em>.
This will automatically do a <em>Google Lucky Search</em> (thanks
to FireFox magic)
and open the XKCD site.</li>
<li>But wait, there's more! Because XKCD has been 
<a href='http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/12/accessibility-mashups-axsjax-fun-with.html'>AxsJAXed</a>, you
will hear Fire-Vox automatically speak the comic strip and its
associated transcript. Hit <code>?</code> in the FireFox
interaction buffer to hear the available keystrokes for this
AxsJAXed application; in general, <code>?</code> brings up
keyboard help for AxsJAXed applications.</li>
</ul>
<h2>ToDos:</h2>

<p>These are some todos that I plan to get to eventually --- if
you have coding cycles to contribute, feel free to work on
these.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an HTTP  binding to the TTS servers using TCL and the
TCL HTTP libraries. This will eliminate the dependency on the
Python wrapper I originally wrote for ORCA  in fall 2005.</li>
<li>Write more  Piglets.</li>
<li>Make installation and configuration simpler.</li>
<li>Test installation and configuration of the various
pieces.</li>
</ul>

<div>
<br>
    <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>
The Nielsen Norman Group has made available a detailed report on
accessibility, which includes the results of several usability
tests
--- see <a href='http://www.nngroup.com/reports/accessibility/'>Going Beyond
 Alt Text</a>.
It's a very good read,  and though its conclusions might be
depressing to people coming to this area from the outside ---
they should be no surprize to users who have been trying to use
the Web via spoken output over the last 10 years.
From the perspective of the Emacspeak user who lives in a
specialized browsing environment that is optimized for performing
oft-repeated tasks, there are several interesting take-aways from
this report:</p>

<ul>
<li>Though so-called <em>Web Accessibility Standards</em> have
attempted to focus on the behavior observed when using
screenreaders with mainstream browsers, that thread of work
appears to be achieving little with respect to the real metric of
<strong>task completion</strong>.
As technologists, we would all do well to remember that users
come to the Web, and Web Access solutions not to <em>use the
browser</em> but rather to complete one or other task.</li>
<li>As described in <a href='http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/raman/publications/specialized-browsers/specialized-browsers.html'>Specialized
Browsers</a>
and <a href='http://www.resourceshelf.com/2007/12/02/webcast-the-web-the-way-you-want-it/'>The
Web The Way You Want It</a>,
task-oriented access and specialized user-optimized web tools
have been around since the inception of the Web.</li>
<li>Though the Nielsen study asked users to carry out each of the
given tasks by going to a given Web site, it would be interesting
to see how such tasks work out in the Emacspeak environment.
It's a given that an emacspeak  user trying to buy a music CD at   an
online store   would run into a brick wall fairly quickly (see,
even online stores are made of brick and mortar;-)).
However, as an Emacspeak user I'd <em>never do that</em> I'd
either go to  Amazon's highly efficient 
<a href='http://www.amazon.com/access'>Amazon Accessible
Store</a>
or faster yet, type an appropriate query at Google and click on the
relevant Ad that sports a <em>Google Checkout</em> badge.</li>
<li>And more interestingly, it would be interesting to carry out
a follow-up user study to compare the rate of task completion as
well as observed efficiencies/inefficiencies 
between users of Emacspeak and generic browser/screenreader
combinations for  tasks such as:

<ol>
<li>Play NPR news from the last hour.</li>
<li>Play your local NPR station.</li>
<li>Play BBC  News from the last hour.</li>
<li>Skim the top stories from CNN.</li>
<li>Look up  today's stock market numbers for the major
indices.</li>
<li>And items too numerous to enumerate in this margin.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>In the spirit of adding a <em>smart URL template</em> to

for useful tools I discover ...</p>

<p>I just checked in a <code>Public Transit Via Google
Maps</code> 
tool into the Emacspeak SVN repository.
You specify trip details in the form <em>start  to
destination</em>
e.g., <a href='http://www.google.com/maps?output=html&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;f=d&amp;dirflg=r&amp;q=2715+la+terrace+circle+San+Jose%2C+CA+to+San+Jose+Airport&amp;ttype=dep&amp;date=11%2F28%2F07&amp;time=now'>2715
La Terrace Circle 95123 to San Jose Airport</a>
and get back a filtered view that shows the information you
want. Note that clicking on the link in this blog will give you
the entire page,
which is fairly easy to navigate. 
But having a smart filter in Emacspeak makes it that much more
efficient to use.

<div>
<br>
    <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>In the first of a sequence of posts demonstrating live
emacspeak user interaction,
I'll give an overview of what it feels like to use Emacspeak's
powerful Web Command Line provided by its rich collection of web
gadgets made up of <em>search wizards</em> and <em>smart url
templates</em></p>
<p>Here are a few things to note about this and all the
subsequent video demos in this series:</p>
<ul>
<li>All demos were recorded using <em>recordmydesktop</em> on an
Ubuntu laptop running Linux (Ubuntu Dapper).</li>
<li>The text-to-speech is  produced by the IBM  ViaVoice engine,
this can now be purchased from a couple of sources in the US and
Europe.</li>
<li>All demos are recorded with the speech rate at which I use
Emacspeak.
These demos are primarily intended to show the efficiency of the
environment, and slowing down the speech would detract
significantly from that goal.</li>
<li>Frequent users of text-to-speech will still find the output
comprehensible. For the rest, you can match it up with what you
see on the screen ;-)</li>
<li>Careful listeners will notice some jitter/clipping in the
audio --- this appears to be an artifact of using
<em>recordmydesktop</em> that I was unable to eliminate.</li>
<li>In each of these articles, I'll enumerate the actions I take,
and their effect. I'll enumearate actual keystrokes, but I
suggest readers focus more on the atomic commands being executed,
rather than individual keypresses.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Looking Up The Weather</h3>
<p>Looking up current weather is a sufficiently common action
where <em>browsing</em> to a weather site, typing in ones
zip-code and reviewing the resulting page is three steps too
many.
This is also why most modern desktop environments provide
<em>gadgets</em> that display such live information with minimal
user intervention.
This first video shows Emacspeak <em>smart url</em> <code>RSS
Weather From Wunderground</code>in action.
</p>
<p>Here is the  <a href='http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/videos/rss-weather.ogg'>RSS
Weather Demo</a>.
This is an OGG/Theora video and should play with tools like
<code>mplayer</code>.
The table below shows  a brief description of each user action
and its effect.</p>

<h3>A Transcript Of What You Hear</h3>

<p>Users who could see the video half of this demo but were not
frequent text-to-speech users reported that it would be useful to
see a transcript of what is being spoken.
I'm revising this entry to have an annotated transcript.
Note that the transcript may not be accurate to the last word,
since I'm typing it in by hand; however it should give one a
sense of what information emacspeak chooses to speak.</p>
<dl>
<dt id='gadget-prompt'>Access Gadgets</dt>
<dd>The spoken prompt is <em>Resource:</em>.</dd>
<dt id='pick-gadget'>Pick Gadget</dt>
<dd>You hear me type <em>RS</em> and then you hear Emacspeak
completing my input to <em>RSSWeather</em>.
Half way through that utterance, I know it's found the right
gadget, so I hit enter, and that stops the utterance
<em>RSSWeather</em> half-way through and speaks the next prompt.
Notice that you also hear auditory icons to indicate that a
prompt input area just opened.</dd>
<dt id='location'>Location</dt>
<dd>With the gadget now selected, you hear the
<em>City/State</em> prompt generated by the weather gadget.
It also produces a default location of <em>CA/San_Jose</em>.
In the demo, you hear the <em>State/City</em> prompt, along with
the default value. I hit enter  midway through that utterance,
again the speech flushes immediately.
The gadget  now has enough information to do its work; it pulls
the RSS feed from Wunderground, converts it to XHTML (using XSLT)
and displays the page using Emacs/W3. Once displayed, it starts
speak the forecast you see on the screen.</dd>
<dt id='forecast'>Forecast</dt>
<dd>Here is a rough transcript of what you hear  as the weather
forecast is spoken. The forecast starts with the words:
<em>Conditions 73 degrees F Partly cloudy 4:50pm PDT  August 18   ...</em>
This is  in a lower-pitched (deeper) voice since it  was
generated from the title of the corresponding RSS item. Emacspeak
uses Aural CSS to produce such audio formatted information.
The contents of the item are spoken in the default voice starting
with the utterance <em>Temperature 73 degrees F 23 degrees C ... Conditions partly cloudy ...</em>
When I've  heard enough, I hit <code>q</code> to quit.</dd>
<dt id='quit'>Quit</dt>
<dd>When I quit the weather gadget, a number of things happen.
<ul>
<li>You hear auditory icon <em>close-object</em> to indicate the
weather forecast being dismissed.</li>
<li>You hear context information indicating that the Emacs
<em>shell buffer</em> has now become current.</li>
<li>For this context information, you hear it speak the working
directory of the shell buffer and the word <em>shell</em></li>
</ul>

See this 
<a href='http://groups.google.com/group/accessible/msg/51153b28f91064bd'>article</a>
by my Google colleague Srinivas Annam that outlines the
availability of GMail Filters from the basic HTML interface.
This was the final piece that remained to convince me to use my
GMail account for email --- now, keeping the GMail Inbox clean
and free of clutter 
has become a snap.</p>
<p>To go with this, I've added a few smart URL templates to
Emacspeak's <em>Web Command Line</em>.
Once you've signed in, you can use 
template <code>GMail Search</code>
to type a search term, and find matching mesages.
Note that GMail uses CSS class <code>msg</code>
to tag the actual contents of a message. You can use this to
advantage by hitting <code>e c</code>
on a message link, and specifying <code>msg</code> as the class
value to filter the message.</p>
<p>At some point I'll add a couple of Emacspeak wizards for
creating filters; the present HTML interface is still a bit too
click intensive for my liking.
But cudos to Srinivas for doing the hard work that lets me
discover the pain points in the HTML interface; until now these
were completely invisible to me since I couldn't  
use GMail from 
the Emacspeak environment.</p>
<p>Emacs/W3 note: Note that signing in to GMail from the main
GMail screen defeats W3.
An easy work-around, and something that is more efficient anyway
is to use 
the <code>glogin.xml</code> form found in Emacspeak --- use

<code>C-e ?/</code> in Emacspeak to pick  that form.
Once you're signed in to Google, you can:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Open your <a href='http://mail.google.com/mail/h/'>inbox
</a></li>
<li>Perform searches to find the message you want</li>
</ul>

<div>
<br>
   <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>In the days of OSS, Emacspeak had a nice Emacs-interface to
<code>aumix</code>
and it is a piece of functionality that I have missed even more
under ALSA,
given that one can do many more sophisticated tweaks to one's
sound-card.
Tool <code>alsamixer</code> --- a full-screen  terminal
application is bewilderingly confusing (at least to me),
and <code>amixer</code> though usable required me to go find out
how it worked  each time I needed  to do something new.
The final straw came last weekend when I tried to record some
Emacspeak demos using <code>recordmydesktop</code>
and needed to configure ALSA so that it would capture sound
directly from the PCM output, rather than the microphone.</p>
<p>To cut a short story even shorter,
I ended up writing  an Emacs wrapper around <code>amixer</code>
called  --- well, you guessed it, <code>amixer</code>.
The code is checked in as 
<a href='http://emacspeak.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/lisp/amixer.el'>amixer.el</a>.
The Emacspeak keybinding <code>C-e (</code> formerly used to
manipulate <code>aumix</code> is now ALSA-aware 
and will intelligently default to using the new
<code>amixer</code> tool if  
<code>/usr/bin/amixer</code> is available.

<p>Users running out of SVN will have noticed that the emacspeak
codebase has  seen a significant number of updates over the last
couple of weeks.
During this time, I've refactored the Web interaction code in
Emacspeak  to meet the following goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>All Emacspeak Web smarts have now been re-factored to be
independent of any given Web browser. In practice, this avoids
code duplication between W3 and W3M support.</li>
<li>The interface to XSLT has been significantly improved.</li>
<li>When using W3, Emacspeak automatically builds a cache of CSS
<code>classnames</code> and <code>ids</code> occuring on the
page.
These are then used to provide interactive completion when
invoking commands 
<code>emacspeak-extract-by-id</code> (bound to <code>e i</code>
in Web pages)
and <code>emacspeak-we-extract-by-class</code> (bound to <code>e
c</code> in Web pages).</li>
<li>Module <code>emacspeak-we</code> holds all code related to
<em>editing</em>
Web pages before they are displayed.</li>
<li>Module <code>emacspeak-webutils</code> holds all Web utility
code.</li>
<li>Atom and RSS feeds are now pulled using Emacs-22 built-in
library <code>url</code>
rather than via libxslt. This has the advantage that the feeds
are pulled with any cookies the browser may have set during the
session.</li>
<li>All <code>url templates</code>, <code>search wizards</code>
and related Web utilities should now be capable of working
similarly under W3 and W3M.</li>
<li>Module <code>emacspeak-moz</code> provides a basic level of
integration with Firefox --- see my related blog post on 
<a href='http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2007/06/firebox-put-fox-in-box.html'>FireBox</a>.</li>
<li>Module <code>emacspeak-w3m</code> still needs work to take
advantage of all of these changes; I myself do not use W3M much,
so those updates will happen as and when W3M users contribute the
necessary time and patches.</li>

<p>So I use module <code>greader</code> (part of package <a href='http://emacspeak.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/lisp/g-client'>G-Client</a>
to read a large number of ATOM and RSS feeds. I have long missed
the ability to search for articles I remember having read a few
weeks or months ago;
though I typically find it with an appropriately phrased Google
Search, 
I've always wanted to have the ability to restrict the search to
the feeds I subscribe to --- this makes formulating   the query
much easier.</p>
<p>The advent of CSEs --- see my earlier blog post 
entitled <a href='http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2007/06/making-search-fly-on-fly-custom-search.html'>On
The Fly Custom Search</a>
combined with Google Reader's ability to export ones subscription
list as an OPML file gives me exactly what  I needed.</p>

<h2>HowTo: Enable Searching Of  Past Articles From Google
Reader</h2>

<ul>
<li>Since you need to be signed in to access the subscription
list, the <em>CSE magic</em> cannot directly retrieve 
your subscription list at present.
as a consequence, you need to retrieve and save your list of
feeds   to a location that is publicly accessible.
Feature Request: Would be nice if Reader did this automatically
by talking to CSE on behalf of the signed-in user --- that would
obviate the next manual step.</li>
<li>Export your subscription list using command
<code>greader-opml</code>.
You'll need to do  an <code>svn update</code>
to get the above command; alternatively, sign in to Google and
retrieve your 
<a href='http://www.google.com/reader/subscriptions/export'>
subscription list</a>.</li>
<li>Finally,   customize emacspeak option 
<code>emacspeak-url-template-reading-list-opml</code> to the
location of the saved OPML file.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, you can use Emacspeak <code>url template</code>
<em>reader subscription search</em> from the Emacspeak Web
Command Line to search articles you remember having seen in your
Google Reader. This is also an excellent means of finding
articles of interest that one might have missed in the past.
As an example, I recently became interested in Selenium --- an
extremely powerful Web application testing framework.
Finding articles from the past that I <em>ought to have read</em>
but hadn't was a snap using the feature describe here.</p>

<p>
The Custom Search  Engine team at Google recently released 
<a href='http://googlecustomsearch.blogspot.com/2007/06/custom-search-on-fly.html'>CSE
On The Fly</a>
a truly amazing feature. Incidentally Google Custom Search is the
same piece of magic that brought us 
<a href='http://labs.google.com/accessible/'>Accessible
Search</a> last year.</p>
<p>So in the spirit of continuing to enhance the Web Command Line
in Emacspeak for every smart Web tool that becomes available,
I've checked in two new <code>url templates</code>
that demonstrate how one can  leverage this to be smart  and
selective about what one reads.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Searching Favorite Feeds</dt>
<dd>So I read a lot of Blogs, my current Blog Reader is Google
Reader via --- you guessed it -- Emacs module 
<a href='http://emacspeak.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/lisp/g-client/greader.el'>GReader</a>
(part of the Emacs G-Client package).
But I often  feel the need to search my favorite feeds.
URL-template <code>Reader Subscriptions</code>
lets you do this; what's more it's not specific to Google
Reader. All you need do is to publish an OPML file listing  your
favorite feeds  and customize Emacs variable
<code>emacspeak-url-template-reading-list-opml</code>
to point to that location.</dd>
<dt>Official GoogleBlog Search</dt>
<dd>Google has a large number of Google-specific Blogs --- I
usually read them through this <em>aggregated</em> feed:
<a href='http://www.google.com/reader/public/subscriptions/user/10949413115399023739/label/officialgoogleblogs-all'>All
  GoogleBlog Stream</a>
Emacspeak wizard <code>Official GoogleBlog Search</code> builds a
CSE from this feed to let you search articles from all of
Google's  blogs.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Eventually, I'll also add a <em>meta</em> search wizard that
lets  one construct any CSE on the fly --- with Lisp such
meta-programming is a snap!</p>
<p>Later yesterday evening, I checked in a third
<code>url-template</code>
called <em>On The Fly CSE</em> that prompts for a search term and
the URL for the  feed of feeds  that specifies the content to search.</p>

  I've finally found the right development environment for myself
  for writing and debugging Web Applications that use JavaScript to
  implement client-side interaction.
It turns out that it wasn't just me who found the thought of
programming inside the Web browser a painful experience ---
pleasant though the final end-user interaction that those results
deliver might be for the final user.
I discovered 
<a href='http://dev.hyperstruct.net/mozlab/wiki/MozRepl'>MozRepl</a>
--- a <em>read-eval-print</em>
loop for Firefox. MozRepl is a Firefox extension that allows you
to open a connection to a running Firefox session and gain access
to  a JavaScript interpreter context that  can access all aspects
of the Firefox runtime.</p>
<p>This is quite neat, I can now use the power of Emacs to write
and debug end-user JavaScript applications.
But wait, there is more. So in general, as someone who doesn't
need  to suffer from the hit on cycles and memory that running an X
environment involves, 
I usually dont start <code>GDM</code> --- the graphical desktop
--- on my Linux box. Believe me, running just at the console,
especially with the LCD turned off makes my laptop run a lot
longer.
So challenge: How do you take the fox's head off Firefox?
How do you run a headless Firefox?</p>
<p>Turns out that the original X Windows developers didn't always
have access to all the displays that they were developing X
applications for --- so they created <code>XVFB</code> --- the X
Virtual Frame Buffer server.
Like all good things in the Open Source world, XVFB continues to
survive --- even though today, X developers hardly if ever resort
to XVFB.
But in the fine UNIX tradition of 
<quote>Get out of my way or I'll turn you into a shell
script</quote>
XVFB also turns out to be just what I needed in order to run
FireFox as a headless application.</p>
<p>So in summary: I'm typing this blog on the shuttle bus riding
home, with the monitor turned off,
and Firefox running headless as I debug some of the code I've
been writing.
If you want to put the fox's head in a box yourself, here is a
pointer to 
<a href='http://emacspeak.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/etc/firebox'>FireBox</a>

<li>Teachers working with visually impaired students.</li>
<li>And the generally curious mathematician who wishes to view

</ul>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
  This essay outlines some of my experiences as a mathematician
  who cannot see. Note that I transitioned to being a Computer
  Scientist during Graduate School. However I strongly believe in
  the edict <q>Once a mathematician, always a mathematician!</q>
  — my training in mathematics continues to influence the
  way I think.
</p>
<p>
  I've been unable to see since the age of 14, which means that
  I've studied and practiced mathematics predominantly in an
  eyes-free environment. This essay is my first conscious attempt
 at asking the question <q>What is involved in doing mathematics
  when you cannot see?</q> I hope that some of the
  experiences outlined here will prove insightful to
  mathematicians at large. At its heart, mathematics is about
  understanding the underlying structure inherent in a given area
  of interest — and where no such structure exists — to
  define the minimal structure that is needed to make forward
  progress.
</p>
<p>
  The general perception that mathematics might be hard to do in
  an eyes-free environment probably traces itself to the common
  view of mathematics as a field where one performs copious
  calculations on paper. I'll illustrate some of the habits and
  abilities one evolves over time to compensate for the lack of
  ready access to <em>scratch memory</em> provided by pencil and
  paper when working in an eyes-free environment. In this essay,
  I hope to demonstrate that mathematics in its essence is
  something far bigger. By being bigger than <q>calculations on
  paper</q>, not being able to see rarely if ever proves an
  obstacle when it comes to doing mathematics; the challenges one
  needs to overcome are primarily centered around gaining access
  to mathematical material, and communicating ones insights with
  fellow mathematicians. Thus, a large portion of this essay
  focuses on solutions to the challenges inherent in mathematical
  communication.

<div>
<br>
    <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>Blogging while at WWW 2007.
I attended the W3C AC meeting the first two days of the week. The
highlight for me from the AC (Advisory Committee meeting was a
panel consisting  of TimBL and Tim OReilly at the end of the day
yesterday. It was fun to hear Tim OReilly  define Web-2.0 --- he
is credited with originally coining the term, but in the last
year, Web 2.0 has often been lightly equated to  
dynamic Web applications that use JavaScript to the extent that
many assume that anything that doesn't  use JavaScript is not
Web-2.0!</p>
<p>The gist of Tim O's definition of Web-2.0 was 
to point out that once  the Web had gained sufficient coverage
and scale, it became possible to build application services on
this Web that drew their value from aggregating the data on the
Web; his examples ranged from Google to Amazon.
His comments were insightful --- my own view now is that Web-2.0
should have been called Web^2 i.e. this current revolution is
about applying the power of the Web to itself.
</p>
<p>The other amusing piece while running around at the conference
and observing what everyone is working on is to realize that now
that <em>Web Gadgets</em> and the like are popular, it's now
considered a fine idea to write light-weight site-specific
tools. Notice that Emacspeak has had this since the late 90's in
the form of first the <em>websearch</em> module, to be later
joined by <em>url-templates</em>. I believe these innovations
arrived earlier on the Emacspeak Webtop as compared to the rest
of the Web for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emacspeak relied on Emacs/W3 for Web functionality,and when
that browser stopped being maintained, there was a strong need to
develop Web tools in the context of Emacspeak.</li>
<li>The visual Web was getting too complex  for use via speech
output,
and given the flexibility of the Emacs environment, and the
arrival of XSLT in 1999, things were well set up to build a
powerful set of Web access wizards.</li>
<li>Task-oriented Web tools in Emacspeak led to the conceptual
<strong>Web Command Line</strong> in Emacspeak at a time when
<em>command-line interfaces</em> were considered passe'.</li>
</ul>

<p>Incidentally when I showed others working in the field of
accessibility these Emacspeak tools during their early days, they
were promptly dismissed as site-specific hacks that wouldn't
scale in the face of generic screenreaders that would <em>handle
every web page</em>.
With the visual Web getting too busy for <em>everyone</em>
mainstream users now have access to productivity solutions such
as Apple's Dashboard Widgets, IGoogle modules that can be placed
on a Web page or the desktop, and other comparable tools. It will
be interesting to see how much longer blind users saddled with
commercial screenreaders will have to wait before seeing similar
tools emerge in their world --- just remember, when that does
arrive, Emacspeak had them in 2000!</p>

<div>
<br>
    <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<h2>1 An Emacs Interface To Google Services</h2>


<p>
Google offers a number of services using a Google account. Many
of these services also expose a Web API. this package provides a
set of Emacs modules for accessing these services from inside
Emacs. These modules are designed with an Emacs-centric, rather
than a Web-browser centered view of the world. Where necessary
Emacs package <code>browse-url</code> is used to invoke the Web browser of
choice. 
</p>
<p>
The current distribution can be downloaded from <a href='http://emacspeak.googlecode.com/files/g-client.tar.bz2'>Google Code Hosting</a> and the source code is available via <a href='http://emacspeak.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/lisp/g-client/'>Subversion</a>. Note
that this is still work in progress. I'm releasing it as part of
the Emacspeak project since I believe the package already has
sufficiently useful functionality for users who spend a large
amount of their time inside Emacs. There is no dependency on
Emacspeak, and all clients provided here can be used without
Emacspeak loaded.
</p>

<h3>1.1 Installation</h3>


<p>
These are needed only if installing package <code>g-client</code>
stand-alone, i.e. outside of Emacspeak.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Unpack the tar archive and place the resulting <code>g-client</code>
directory on your emacs <code>load-path</code>.
</li>
<li>
Type <code>make</code> to compile the code.
</li>
<li>
In your .emacs, add <code>(load-library "g")</code> to set it up.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.2 How It Works</h3>


<p>
Clients are implemented using Google APIs based on Atom
Publishing Protocol <a href='http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-09.html'>APP</a> and Google Data APIs (<a href='http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/index.html'>GData</a>). We use <code>curl</code>
to retrieve content via <i>HTTPS</i> and <code>xsltproc</code> to transform the
retrieved content to browsable HTML.
</p>
<p>
Clients sign you in the first time you invoke commands that require
authentication. Once signed in, the session cookie is cached for future
use. Session cookies presently expire in 30 minutes, and clients check for
expired cookies when authentication is needed. If the cookie has expired,
clients retrieve a fresh cookie using the authentication credentials provided
earlier. Note that authorization tokens etc are specific to a
given service.
</p>

<h3>1.3 Top-level Customizations</h3>


<p>
All clients in this package use Emacs' <code>customize</code> interface to
set user preferences.
The most commonly used  ones are enumerated below.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>g-user-email</code> Default email-id to use. Individual clients
typically override this via user option
<code>&lt;clientname&gt;-user-email</code>.
</li>
<li>
<code>g-html-handler</code> Name of function that handles HTML content.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.4 Google Blogger <i>gblogger</i></h3>


<p>
This client implements posting, editting and deleting of blog
entries using the new Blogger API --- it replaces the now
obsolete <a href='http://emacsgeek.blogspot.com/2006/01/announcing-atom-blogger.html'>atom-blogger</a> that implemented similar functionality
using the old Blogger API. It uses value of customization option
<code>g-user-email</code> by default; this can be overridden via option
<code>gblogger-user-email</code>. See <a href='http://code.google.com/apis/blogger/overview.html'>Blogger GData API</a> for the underlying
APIs used. For editing posts, I recommend installing <a href='http://www.thaiopensource.com/nxml-mode/'>nxml-mode</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Browse</i> Command <code>gblogger-blog</code> brings up the list of blogs
owned by the currently authenticated user.
</li>
<li>
<i>Posting</i> Command <code>gblogger-new-entry</code> takes a <b>post URL</b> and sets
up a special buffer where you can compose your
article. the <b>post url</b> is obtained from the feed of blogs
above, use the <b>post</b> link for the blog to which you wish to
post.
</li>
<li>
<i>Browsing</i>      Command <code>gblogger-atom-display</code> displays the
atom feed for a specified blog as a browsable HTML page. In
addition to reading your blog, this helps you find the <b>edit     url</b> for individual posts.
</li>
<li>
<i>Editting</i> Command <code>gblogger-edit-entry</code> takes the <b>edit url</b>
of a previously posted entry. It retrieves the entry, and
sets up a special composition buffer where you can edit the entry.
</li>
<li>
<i>Submitting</i> The special composition buffer created by
commands <code>gblogger-new-entry</code> and <code>gblogger-edit-entry</code>
provide a special command <code>gblogger-publish</code> (bound to <code>C-c     C-c</code>) that submits the entry to blogger.
</li>
<li>
<i>Deleting</i> Command <code>gblogger-delete-entry</code> deletes an entry
specified by its <b>edit url</b>.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.5 Google Calendar <i>gcal</i></h3>


<p>
This client can be used to view, add or delete events from the
Google Calendar for the authenticated user. It uses value of
customization option <code>g-user-email</code> by default; this can be
overridden via option <code>gcal-user-email</code>. Commands that display
calendar items optionally accept the feed url of the calendar to
view; this can be used to view calendars to which the
authenticated user has read access. See <a href='http://code.google.com/apis/calendar/overview.html'>GData Calendar API</a> for
the underlying APIs used.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>View</i> Command <code>gcal-calendar-agenda</code> displays the default
calendar for the authenticated user. A prefix arg prompts for
the calendar to display. This command is best used from
inside the Emacs calendar; in this case, it uses the date
under point when showing the agenda.
</li>
<li>
<i>Add</i> Command <code>gcal-add-event</code> prompts for event details and
adds it to the calendar.
</li>
<li>
<i>Accept</i> Command <code>gcal-accept-event</code> accepts an event. Event
is specified using the <b>edit url</b> of the event.
</li>
<li>
<i>Delete</i> Command <code>gcal-delete-event</code> deletes an event. Event
is specified using the <b>edit url</b> of the event.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.6 Google Reader <i>greader</i></h3>


<p>
This client allows the authenticated user to read, browse and
subscribe/unsubscribe to feeds.
It uses value of customization option <code>g-user-email</code> by
default; this can be overridden via option <code>g-user-email</code>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Reading</i> Command <code>greader-reading-list</code> displays the
reading list (river of news).
</li>
<li>
<i>Browsing</i> Command <code>greader-feed-list</code> displays a
browsable Web page with pointers to  subscribed feeds.
</li>
<li>
<i>Finding</i> Command <code>greader-find-feeds</code> searches for matching
feeds to subscribe.
</li>
<li>
<i>Subscribing</i> Commands <code>greader-subscribe-feed</code> and
<code>greader-unsubscribe-feed</code> are used to subscribe and
unsubscribe.
</li>
<li>
<i>Labeling</i> Command <code>greader-star</code> and <code>greader-add-label</code> are
used to label articles.
</li>
<li>
<i>Reading</i> Starred  articles can be read by
providing a prefix argument to command
<code>greader-reading-list</code>. Thus, C-u M-x greader-reading-list
will prompt for the specific set of articles to retrieve.

</li>
</ul>

<div>
<br>
    <div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>
I've now made all Emacspeak releases available from the download
area on Googlecode.
Going forward, all Emacspeak releases will be made at the
GoogleCode site   --- not SourceForge. This is because uploading
code to GoogleCode is <em>significantly</em> easier than making
releases on SourceForge.</p>

<p>But even more importantly, once uploaded, grabbing a release
from GoogleCode is significantly easier than on SourceForge's
release mechanisms.
You can always find a link to the latest releases from Emacspeak
on GoogleCode 
by starting from the 
<a href='http://code.google.com/p/emacspeak/'>Emacspeak
GoogleCode</a> page.
Follow the link labeled <em>Featured Downloads</em> to download
the newest release. I've also made all past releases from the
download area --- follow the link labeled <em>downloads</em> on
the Emacspeak GoogleCode page.</p>

<p>Here is a brief summary of why I  chose to start making
releases on GoogleCode, it can be viewed as a short summary of
the positives in making the switch.</p>

<ul>
<li> GoogleCode makes it possible to create download URLs  that
can be bookmarked.
No more clicking through multiple pages before getting to the
file you want, you can simply point <code>wget</code>,
<code>curl</code> or your favorite download tool at a meaningful
URL.
For instance,  
here is a pointer to 
 
<a href='http://emacspeak.googlecode.com/files/emacspeak-25.tar.bz2'>Emacspeak
25</a> release.</li>
<li>The above is more than a convenience --- it's in line with
good Web architecture. I've  been looking for an alternative to
SourceForge ever since that site decided to turn meaningful
download URLs from the past into obfuscated pointers into their
content management system; this left me with a feeling of having
created Open Source Software only to have it locked away in
someone else's vault with no easy mechanism for end-users to
retrieve what had been released as free software.</li>
</ul>

<p>Share And Enjoy --- and let's hope we never have download
sites that say <em>Glad to be of service </em>
as they close behind you with a sigh of a job well done.</p>

<div>
<br><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>
I had earlier reported the IBM TTS engine segfaulting on my home
Ubuntu 6 machine; I'm still to fix that problem. 
Surprizingly though, I tried it on a different Ubuntu 6 machine,
and there, installing 
<pre>
sudo apt-get install libstdc++2.10-glibc2.2
</pre>
on top of the regular Ubuntu install was enough to get the TTS
working.
The segfault on my home machine occurs inside libc, and as best I
can tell the two machines have identical libc installs. 
So on the positive front, it's only my home machine that appears
broken; on the negative side, the fact that the breakage is hard
to explain and hence fix doesn't inspire confidence  in
upgrading.
Others have reported not having any problems on Edgy -- so the
problem is hopefully transitory.

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>I released Emacspeak 25.0 (ActiveDog) yesterday.
Here are the <a href="http://emacspeak.sf.net/releases/release-25.0.html">release
notes</a>.</p>
<p>While trying to release it on Sourceforge I ran into a couple
of show-stoppers --- first off the SourceForge download mechanism
has changed <em>yet again</em> and it's now gotten sufficiently
convoluted that  software released via SourceForge's file release
system is becoming well-nigh impossible to download except for
the most motivated user. Worse, as I released the file, upload
services on SourceForge hung, with a consequence that it created
a 0 sized <code>emacspeak-25.tar.bz2</code> file --- the
SourceForge mechanism  made it well-nigh impossible to clean up
the 0-sized file.</p>
<p>Given this mess, I decided to keep things simple by placing
the <a href="http://emacspeak.sf.net/emacspeak-25.tar.bz2">release on
the Emacspeak site </a> directly -- this suffers from the
disadvantage of the release not getting mirrored on the various
Sourceforge download archives; it has the advantage of allowing
users to grab the release with one click.</p>

<p>The other thing to note about this release is that there are
no RPMs built  --- a first in 7 years. I've now switched to
Ubuntu on my home machine and dont have the ability to build RPMs
so I'll leave this  to individual distributions. I've also not
built Debian packages this time around, mostly because I've not
gotten around to understanding Debian's packaging system
sufficiently well to do this. Moreover I prefer minimalistic
packaging solutions --- and in general  though Debian's packaging
is nice, it still feels a little too heavy-weight for something
like the Emacspeak source tarball which needs a simple
<code>make; sudo make install</code> to get set up.
So for now, I'll rely on folks like Jim Van Zandt to build
downstream Debian 
packages  for incorporating with the various distributions like
Debian and Ubuntu --- this way, packages can be built to match
particular distributions.</p>

<h3>What Is It?</h3>
<p>HelixPlayer --- installable on  modern Linux 
distributions as <code>hxplay</code> from package
<code>HelixPlayer</code> is the community-supported version of
RealPlayer 10. The well-distributed and documented client,
<code>hxplay</code>
is capable of playing a wide variety of audio and video formats
over HTTP and RTSP/RTP, and specifically, can handle RealPlayer10
formats which includes support for <em>5.1</em> audio.</p>

<p>A lesser known set of tools available from Helix ---<a href="http://forms.helixcommunity.org/helix/builds/?category=helixdnaclient">
Helix DNA Client</a> is a bare-bones UI-less player which can be
used effectively  at the shell. You can download pre-built
binaries for your flavor of Linux (GCC3.2 or later vs GCC 2.95
based systems) 
note that these are 
nightly builds. You can also download a source zip archive. Note
that all of these requires you to accept a 
 End Users License Agreement (<code>EULA</code>)
before being taken to the download link.</p>
<p>The links on the page above can be confusing; Here are

<code>/usr/bin/hsplay</code>
to launch the player:
<pre>

SPLAY_LIB=/usr/lib/splay
export HELIX_LIBS=$SPLAY_LIB
exec /usr/bin/aoss $SPLAY_LIB/splay -iss -s "$@"

<li> The above script assumes you have the <code>alsa-oss</code>
package nstalled; you will need this to have Helix Player use
ALSA --- something that is essential if you want to be able to
use your sound card with other applications while playing media
streams.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this setup, you can launch one or more media streams
(both local, as well as remote HTTP/RTSP/RTP streams)
from a shell.
This player successfully plays the <code>BBC Radio4 LW</code>
stream, something <code>mplayer</code>
fails to play on my Ubuntu box.</p>

<p>I upgraded my home FC3 machine to Ubuntu 6.0.6 (Dapper) over
the weekend. Here is a short summary for things to watch out for
as an emacspeak user.</p>
<h2>The Good, The Bad, And The Painful</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Good</dt>
<dd>One of my friends helped with the install and it is
remarkably quick when everything works (in my case the Ubuntu LTS
6.0.6 installer had trouble with the NVidea display card and
came up correctly at the third attempt).</dd>
<dt>Bad</dt>
<dd>A one CD install is nice -- but after it you have remarkably
little installed from the perspective of an emacspeak user. You
end up with a very nice GUI but very little else --- the
reasoning being that the average user wont need much more, and
the savvy user can always run <code>apt-get</code>.</dd>
<dt>Bad</dt>
<dd>Worse, Ubuntu does not install <code>openssh-server</code>
--- it limits itself to installing
<code>openssh-client</code>. This means that you cannot bootstrap
yourself by logging in from another machine until you install
<code>openssh-server</code> off the network. If there was one
thing I would ask the Ubuntu maintainers, it would be to rectify
this situation.</dd>
<dt>Painful</dt>
<dd>In my case, the <code>apt</code> suite of tools appeared to
have a problem --- they died saying
<code>/var/lib/dpkg/available: no such file or
directory</code>. Googling showed this to be a known problem with
<code>apt</code> and the fix is to run <code>dselect
update</code> -- but if you're new to Debian/ubuntu,  this is
less than obvious.</dd>
<dt>Good</dt>
<dd>Once you overcome the above, <code>apt-get</code> got me
emacspeak-17.0 which was sufficient to let me bootstrap the rest
of the process on my own using my trusted Dectalk Express to
produce speech.</dd>
<dt>Painful</dt>
<dd>Note that you should install <code>tcl8.3</code> and
<code>tclx8.3</code> --- rather than the newest (8.4) versions of
these packages.
This is because as of 8.4, the maintainers of those packages no
longer build a stand-alone <code>tcl</code> (extended TCL)
shell. This is something that will have to be handled by
Emacspeak in the future.</dd>
<dt>Good</dt>
<dd>I was able to get everything I needed (and more) installed
using a combination of <code>apt-get</code> and
<code>aptitude</code>.</dd>
<dt>Bad</dt>
<dd>The IBM TTS engine no longer works --- under FC3 and friends,
you needed to install package <code>libstdc++-compat</code> to
get it to work. Well, there is no corresponding package for
Ubuntu/Debian from what I could find out, and pulling in the RPM
for <code>libstdc++-compat</code>,
converting it via <code>alien</code> and installing the result
produces a segfault when you run the TTS engine.</dd>
<dt>Bad</dt>
<dd>For the same reason, the old command-line
<code>trplayer</code> will also not work on Ubuntu 6.0.
This is not as painful --- since mplayer works --- though I had
to build <code>mplayer</code> from source.
It would be nice to create a command-line player on top of the
HelixPlayer code base.
At present, the missing <code>trplayer</code> means that the
<code>etc/rivo.pl</code> provided by emacspeak no longer works.
You can use <code>mplayer</code> to  convert
<code>realaudio</code> to mp3; however <code>mplayer</code>does
not have a command-line option to specify the duration of
playback,
something that  script <code>etc/rivo.pl</code> needs.</dd>

The project page is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/emacspeak">Emacspeak at GoogleCode</a>.
You can find Emacspeak --- complete  with its code history going
back to the point where I started using CVS at
<a href="http://emacspeak.googlecode.com/svn/">Emacspeak SVN

<p>For now, the Emacspeak Web site will continue to live at

Vassar as before.
To checkout the code from SVN, follow the instructions on 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/emacspeak/source">
Emacspeak SVN</a>.
If you run into any hitches  in checking out the code, please
report it on the Emacspeak mailing list. Note that you can
anonymous checkout the code from the above location entirely from
the shell command-line without ever having to point a browser at
anything.</p>
<p>Emacspeak users presently running out of SourceForge CVS might

svn. Here are the minimal steps you need to perform: 
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>svn checkout http://emacspeak.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
emacspeak </code></li>
<li>The above will create a directory called
<code>emacspeak</code> with the code under it; obviously, you
should do this somewhere different from where you have  your
current copy of emacspeak.</li>
<li>For now, I recommend renaming the directory created in the
above step to <code>svn-emacspeak</code> so that you can easily
tell  which snapshot you're looking at. </li>

<div>
<br><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I've received a number of queries asking about the differences
between Emacspeak and Speechdel ---especially given some of the
somewhat confusing assertions made in recent Speechdel release
announcements. I'm posting this article in the hope of clearing
up some of this confusion.
</p>
<h2>
<a name="sec-1">1 Emacspeak And Speechdel  -*- mode:org -*-</a>
</h2>
<h3>
<a name="sec-2">1.1 Background</a>
</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://emacspeak.sf.net">Emacspeak</a> speech-enables Emacs by advising core emacs
functionality.  Speech services are provided by a simple
Emacspeak speech-server.  Additionally, Emacspeak implements
speech-extensions for popular emacs modules --- see the 
<a href="http://emacspeak.sf.net/applications.html">speech-enabled applications list</a>.
</p>
<p>
Emacspeak was first released in 1995, and then (as now), there
was limited speech access to the Linux GUI.  Therefore, to be
useful as a complete access solution, Emacspeak has always needed
to enable the user to <b>do everything</b> from within Emacs, not just
regular editing operations. As a case in point, emacspeak users
are probably one of the last remaining communities that use Emacs
for browsing the Web.
</p>
<h3>
<a name="sec-3">1.2 Speech Dispatcher (SpeechD)</a>
</h3>
<p>
The idea of SpeechD --- peech Dispatcher as an intermediate layer
between speech clients and TTS engines was first floated sometime
in the late 90's.  Such a common layer is a laudible goal but is
something that takes time and effort to get right. Additionally,
you have the challenge of geting existing software e.g.,
emacspeak, to abandon their own speech abstraction and
re-implement against a supposedly more generic, but completely
untested and untried intermediate layer.
</p>
<p>
The developers of SpeechD initially incorporated some of the
Emacspeak code into an Emacs wrapper (speechdel) that called
SpeechD, but later decided to go their own way -- and present
<a href="http://www.freebsoft.org/speechd-el">speechdel</a> is the result.
</p>
<p>
Like Emacspeak, speechdel uses Emacs Lisp's advice facility to
add spoken feedback to core editing commands; speech output is
produced by calling out to speech-dispatcher.
</p>
<p>
The summary of feature differences between Emacspeak and speechdel in the
next section is from examining the speechdel code-base; I have
not run speechdel since its dependency chain resulting from
speechd was difficult to resolve on my FC3 64bit machine.
</p>
<h3>
<a name="sec-4">1.3 Emacspeak Features Not Found In SpeechDel</a>
</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Emacspeak implements Aural CSS <a href="http://www.w3.org/Press/1998/CSS2-REC">ACSS</a>, and uses it to  provides
the aural analog of <code>font-lock</code>.
</li>
<li>
Emacspeak provides pronunciation
dictionaries. Pronunciations can be defined on a per-mode,
per-buffer or per-directory basis. Directory and mode
specific pronunciations are persisted across sessions. This
allows Emacspeak to leverage Emacs' intelligence about the
semantics of a given application; thus, you can have
it say "p arrow x" for "p-&gt;x" when editing C
code. Per-directory pronunciations are useful for reading
electronic books. Per-buffer pronunciations are useful for
succinctly speaking long lines of shell output e.g. when
compiling complex software.
</li>
<li>
By advising core Emacs functionality, Emacs modes work out
of the box with Emacspeak. But in most cases, Emacspeak goes
one step further by providing light-weight speech-modules
that specialize spoken output for a given mode. As an
example, advising next-line to speak the current line is
sufficient to use <code>dired-mode</code> --- but having to listen to
the entire line of dired output is not a pleasant
experience. The dired-specific module in Emacspeak advises
all interactive dired commands to speak the "right"
information. As an another example, GUD interaction
automatically speaks the line of source-code without leaving
the <b>Gud</b> buffer.
</li>
<li>
Emacspeak comes with many "Emacs Applets" for performing
tasks that most users would perform outside of
Emacs. Examples include playing CDs, playing multimedia
streams etc. Fortunately, I have not had to write too many
of these since there are always Emacs users other than
myself who also create such Emacs applications --- so where
Emacs applications already exist, I merely speech-enable
them with a small set of advice definitions, and in some
cases add a few additional interactive commands.
</li>
<li>
Emacs applications are plentiful for most tasks; one
exception is the Web. Since emacs/w3 development was
abandoned sometime around 1998, I have added significant Web
interaction functionality to Emacspeak using Emacs/W3 as the
basis. Today, a lot of this has also been ported to
Emacs/W3M thanks to other enthusiasts on the Emacspeak
mailing list.  Examples include:
<ol>
<li>
WebSearch module --- prompts for query and processes
response to focus on the results.
</li>
<li>
XSLT pre-processing: Allows pre-processing of complex
pages before rendering via W3. Used to enable <b>smart</b>
screen-scrapers using XPath.
</li>
<li>
URL-Tempaltes: Originally motivated by <code>webjump.el</code>, this
provides url templates that enable easy access to a
variety of Web tasks rangig from looking up flight times
to listening to your favorite NPR or BBc show. Think early
cut at a "Web Command Line in the minibuffer".
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
Customization via Custom, including additional
keymaps. Comes with additional keymap files for the Linux
console to enable <code>hyper</code>, <code>super</code>, and <code>alt</code> prefix
keymaps.
</li>
<li>
Module emacspeak-wizards iplements a large collection of
Emacs wizards that enable common tasks that you would
otherwise perform at the shell e.g., checking display status
on a laptop. The additional prefix keymaps come in handy!
</li>
</ol>
8)Finally, note that <b>all</b> modules (except the core) are loaded
on demand.All code is compiled with <code>byte-compile-dynamic</code> set to
=T=  and individual application-specific modules  are kept
completely independent of one another. Given the size of the
Emacspeak codebase, this is a  pre-requisite for both efficiency
and developer sanity.

<div>
<br><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>And now, with ALSA working well with software TTS and
cooperating with ALSA_aware streaming applications 
such as <code>mplayer</code> it's time to close the legacy loop
for those few applications that still have the old
<code>OSS</code> API hard-wired.</p>
<p>One such useful application is <code>trplayer</code> --- the
command-line <em>real player</em> that has not been updated in
over 4 years.
For the most part, the functionality provided by
<code>trplayer</code> is subsumed by the newer --- and actively
maintained --- <code>mplayer</code> but it's still useful to have
<code>trplayer</code> for times when <code>mplayer</code> hits
gliches with slow-responding RTSP streams.</p>
<p>The ALSA way of handling such legacy applications is through
the <em>ALSA OSS</em> emulation layer; Emacspeak now contains a
script <code>etc/atrplayer</code> that invokes
<code>trplayer</code> via <code>aoss</code>.  Incidentally for
the more observant Emacspeak user running out of CVS, script
<code>atrplayer</code> is not new; it has been around for about a
year, but until now it used command <code>vsound</code> to stream
the converted audio to command <code>aplay</code>. I needed to do
this until ALSA 1.0.11 since <code>trplayer</code> used to fail
sporadically if run through the <code>AOSS</code> emulation
layer.  But those problems now seem to be in the past with the
upgrade to ALSA 1.0.11.  As usual with cutting edge technology
like ALSA, your mileage with <strong>all of this</strong> will vary; so
let me end with the usual disclaimer --- if it breaks, you get to
keep both pieces.</p>

In <a href="http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2006/06/emacspeak-tts-alsa-and-asym.html">ALSA
and ASYM</a>
I mentioned that <code>speakfreely</code> appeared to have
stopped working.
As it turns out, this had nothing to do with the switch to
ASYM. I believe that in the past I had run speakfreely by first
killing software TTS --- since by default
<code>speakfreely</code> uses OSS.</p>
<p>Getting <code>speakfreely</code> working with ALSA without
losing software TTS required the following steps;</p>
<ol>
<li>Retrieve the latest  tarball 
<code>speak_freely-7.6a.tar.gz</code></li>
<li>Uncomment the <code>ALSA</code> specific line in its
<code>Makefile</code></li>
<li>In file <code>audio_alsa.c</code>, change the default audio
device from <code>plughw:0,0</code> to <code>default</code>.
Without this change, speakfreely will try to  access the sound
card directly; setting it to <code>default</code>
on line 41:
<pre>
char *devAudioOutput = "default";
</pre>
matches things up with the <code>pcm.default</code> that was
configured in the <code>.asoundrc</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>With this, you can now talk using <code>speakfreely</code> and
continue to use software TTS.

This is a continuation of the earlier thread about using ALSA for
software TTS using DMix ---
see <a href="http://emacspeak.blogspot.com/2006/05/asoundrc-parameters-for-reliably-using.html">ASoundrc
And Emacspeak</a>.</p>

<p>I've now updated the CVS version of <code>ASoundRC</code> to
use the <code>ASYM</code>
plugin for the default ALSA device. 
The <code>ASYM</code> plugin allows you to configure both the
playback and capture device, which removes the annoyance of
having to specify an ALSA device when calling
<code>arecord</code> --- as used to be the case when using
<code>DMIX</code> in the <code>pcm.default</code> device.</p>

<p>Possible Caveats:
I am having trouble getting <code>speakfreely</code> to work
reliably --- I've used  it with ALSA in the past --- though I'm
not sure if the <code>ASYM</code> plugin is the culprit.</p>

<p> 
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture 
<a href="http://www.alsa-project.org/">
ALSA</a> is a boon for software TTS users --- you can now use
your soundcard to produce spoken output while not losing 
audio output from other applications such as music players and
streaming radio stations.</p>
<p>Emacspeak implements an ALSA-enabled TTS server for the IBM
ViaVoice engine --- 
using this server effectively requires appropriately tuning the
parameters in the user's <code>asoundrc</code> file to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable the <code>DMix</code> plugin to enable software mixing
of multiple channels of audio.</li>
<li>To configure the various parameters ALSA itself uses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on how well your sound-card is supported by ALSA,
the above can be either trivially simple or a  tedious process of
trial and error. I'm writing this up to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect a  list of sound cards on which the
<code>asoundrc</code> provided with Emacspeak works as
expected.</li>
<li>In the hope that the wider ALSA community discovers and helps
flesh out this material;
my hope is that 
the ALSA community has more insight into how these settings
work.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the above, <em>works effectively</em> means the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The TTS engine speaks without perceptible stuttering or other
audio artifacts.</li>
<li>The engine is responsive with respect to starting and
stopping speech; especially when typing fast at high speech
rates.</li>
<li>The TTS engine does not interfere with other alsa-enabled
applications, e.g. <code>mplayer</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of this entry, you can find the relevant section
from the    <code>asoundrc</code> file from the Emacspeak
distribution, with comments indicating which sound cards perform
well.
An example of a card that <em>does not</em> work well with these
settings is the Audigy-LS from Creative; the TTS engine works on
that card, but performs degrades:
</p>
<ul>
<li>mplayer cannot use the audio device; (aplay and mpg321 are
able to share the card with the TTS engine.)</li>
<li>Speech does not stop immediately as on the soundcards
enumerated in the <code>asoundrc</code> file.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The similarities between Web access issues faced 
by mobile users and those confronting eyes-free Web browsing are
striking, and these similarities have often been used to advocate
the creation of well-structured, accessible  Web content. As an
example of mobile-friendly content 
being a blessing for eyes-free spoken access to WebFormation,
Emacspeak provides a 
<em>mobile lens</em> via the
<a href="http://www.google.com/gwt/n">
Google Mobile</a> transcoder.</p>
<p>
Here are a few convenient means of using the above within the
Emacspeak Audio Desktop:</p>

<ul>
<li>While browsing the Web using <code>w3</code>,
press <code>t</code> on a link (command:
<code>emacspeak-w3-transcode-via-google</code>)
to view that link through the mobile transcoder.</li>
<li>Note that all links in the resulting mobile view
automatically go through the transcoder.</li>
<li>To  undo the effect of automatically viewing links in the
mobile view through the transcoder, use <code>t</code> with a
<em>interactive prefix argument</em>
i.e., press <code>C-u t</code> to follow a link to view it in its
original form.</li>
<li>Additionally, I bind command
<code>emacspeak-wizards-google-transcode</code>
to a convenient key so that I can launch Web sites using the
mobile view.</li>
</ul>

<p>I use this tool on a regular basis while commuting to work  to
browse mainstream news sites, it provides speech-friendly content
that has the added benefit of downloading fast over a wireless
link --- after all, <strong>this is <em>Mobile</em>
content</strong>.

<p>
Here is a minor patch to w3.el to allow it to handle content-type
<code>application/xhtml+xml</code>.
For all practical  purposes (at least as far as W3 is concerned),
this can be handled by the html parser/renderer; however since that
content-type did not exist at the time W3 was written, it offers
to download/save  documents of that type.
The attached patch fixes this, and also adds a fix to a minor
irritant with decoding of multimedia attachments.</p>

<div>
<br><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Emacs/W3 is still the best Web page rendering option inside
Emacspeak given the ability to apply XSL transforms, as well as
obtaining aural styling via ACSS.
However W3's url handling layer often breaks when faced with
multiple redirects, especially when some of these happen through
the <code>Host:</code> HTTP header. Additionally,
<code>HTTPS</code> authentication sometimes fails mysteriously in
the presence of redirects.</p>

<p>In many of these cases, <code>lynx</code> happily fetches the
pages correctly; however you're then stuck using  a  fairly weak
auditory interface in that Emacspeak degrades to being
aterminal level screenreader.</p>

<p>An effective solution to this problem is to use
<code>lynx</code> within an Emacs terminal, and after finding the
content that is worth reading, handing off that content to
Emacs/W3. The next few paragraphs show how.</p>

<H4>The <code>lynx-site.cfg</code> File</H4>

<p>This is where you add site-specific configurations.
Here are the lines I have in my <code>lynx-site.cfg </code> to
integrate <code>lynx</code> and Emacs.
Before you use any of this, make sure you have executed <code>M-x
server-start</code> in your running Emacs, and make sure that all
is well by experimenting with <code>emacsclient</code> to ensure
that external programs can hand-off editting tasks to the
currently running Emacs.</p>


<pre>
#site defaults
#for bookshare:
DOWNLOADER:BKS Unpack:bks.pl  %s %s:TRUE 
PRINTER:Edit:emacsclient %s:TRUE
KEYMAP:???:EDITTEXTAREA	# use external editor to edit a form textarea
PRETTYSRC:TRUE
SOURCE_CACHE:MEMORY
SAVE_SPACE:~/.wget/
BOLD_HEADERS:TRUE
PRINTER:W3:emacsclient -e '(w3-open-local "%s")':TRUE
</pre>
<p>Below, I'll describe what each of the above lines do:</p>

<ul>

<li> <code>DOWNLOADER:BKS Unpack:bks.pl  %s %s:TRUE </code><br/>
The above line creates an additional item in the <em>download
menu</em> that invokes the BookShare unpacker.
Script <code>bks-unpack.pl</code> invokes the BookShare unpack
tool with the appropriate options.</li>
<li><code>PRINTER:Edit:emacsclient %s:TRUE</code><br/>
This creates an <em>Edit</em> item in the <em>print menu</em>.
Invoking this menu item causes the current page to be handed off
to Emacs for editting.
If you want to edit the source, first switch to <em>source
view</em> by hitting <code>\</code> before invoking print.</li>
<li><code>KEYMAP:???:EDITTEXTAREA	# use external editor to
edit a form textarea</code><br/>
This sets lynx up so that when editting a multiline textarea, you
can hand off the editting job to Emacs. This is particularly
useful for editting Wiki pages. Replace the <code>??</code> with
the desired key sequence.</li>
<li><code>PRETTYSRC:TRUE<br/>
SOURCE_CACHE:MEMORY</code><br/>
The above two settings make the edit source functionality more
pleasant to use.</li>
<li> <code>PRINTER:W3:emacsclient -e '(w3-open-local
"%s")':TRUE</code><br/>
The above creates a <em>W3</em> menu item in the <em>print
menu</em>. Invoking this  causes Emacs/W3 to display the current
page --- again switch to <code>source view</code> before invoking
this so that Emacs/W3 gets handed the HTML markup.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Do not directly customize <code>voice-bolden</code> and friends, instead
customize the corresponding <code>voice-bolden-settings</code>, since that
ensures that all voices that are defined in terms of
<code>voice-bolden</code> get correctly updated.</li>

<li>Discovering what to customize:</li>
</ol>

<p>Command <code>emacspeak-show-personality-at-point</code> (bound by default
to C-e M-v) will show you the value of properties personality and
face at point. A recent update I implemented last weekend makes
this more useful, so make sure you do a CVS update; earlier this
command used to display the ACSS setting --- now it displays the
abstract name. Describe-variable on these names should tell you
what to customize; so as an example:</p>

<p>Put point on a comment line, and hit <code>C-e M-v</code>:
you will hear</p>

<pre class="example">
Personality emacspeak-voice-lock-comment-personality
Face font-lock-comment-delimiter-face
</pre>

<p>Describe-variable of <code>emacspeak-voice-lock-comment-personality</code> gives:</p>

<pre class="example">
emacspeak-voice-lock-comment-personality's value is acss-p0-s0-all

Documentation:
Personality used for font-lock-comment-face
This personality uses  voice-monotone whose  effect can be changed globally by customizing voice-monotone-settings.

</pre>


<h3>How It All Works</h3>

<p class="first">Here is a brief explanation of the connection between
<code>voice-bolden</code> and its associated <code>voice-bolden-settings</code>.</p>


<ol>
<li>Voice  settings are initially in <code>voice-bolden-settings</code> which is a list
of numbers.</li>

<li>That list of numbers needs to be translated to appropriate
device-specific codes to send to the TTS engine.</li>

<li>You do not want to do this translation <em>each</em> time you
speak something.</li>

<li>So when <code>voice-bolden</code> is defined, the definition happens in
two steps:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>The list of settings is stored away in
<code>voice-bolden-settings</code>,</li>
<li>A corresponding voice-name is generated ---
<code>acss-a&lt;n&gt;-p&lt;n&gt;-r&lt;n&gt;-s&lt;n&gt;</code> and the corresponding control codes to
send to the device are stored away in a hash-table keyed by the above symbol.</li>

<li>Finally, <code>voice-bolden</code> is assigned the above symbol.</li>
</ul>


<h3>What this gives is:</h3>

<ol>
<li>The ability to customize the voice via custom by editting
the list of numbers in <code>voice-bolden-settings</code></li>

<li>When that list is editted, <code>voice-bolden</code> is arranged to be
updated automatically.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Other Useful Commands</h3>
<p>In addition, commands
<code>emacspeak-wizards-generate-voice-sampler</code> can be
useful in generating a buffer that shows what the various ACSS
settings sound like.
Command <code>emacspeak-wizards-voice-sampler</code> can be used
to apply a specific voice to a region of text while experimenting
with the various settings.</p>

<div>
<br><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Emacspeak speech-enables <em>SuDoKu</em> implemented  by <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~jr2075/elisp/index.html">sudoku.el</a>.
Speech-enabling games is an effective means of discovering what
additions one needs to make to an auditory interface for
working effectively in an eyes-free environment --- this was
aptly demonstrated a few years ago by identifying interesting
<em>conversational gestures</em> by speech-enabling the game of
<code>Tetris</code> --- see  <a href="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/raman/publications/assets-98/paper.pdf">Conversational
Gestures For The Audio Desktop</a> from Assets 1998.</p>


<h4>Advicing Interactive Commands</h4>
<p>As with speech-enabling any Emacs module,
<code>emacspeak-sudoku</code> <em>advices</em> all interactive
commands to produce spoken feedback.
In addition to speaking the cell moved to, all navigation
commands produce an auditory icon that is a function of whether
the cell value is mutable ---  original values cannot be changed
and this is indicated with a distinctive icon.</p>

<h4>Additional Interactive Commands</h4>

<p>Playing SuDoKu effectively requires one to build a good mental
image of the state of the board as well as the ability to
effectively query the game for currently active constraints. The
eye's ability to  quickly move around the board and perceive row,
column and sub-square constraints needs to be compensated for in
an eyes-free environment. As an example, it is too difficult to
build the necessary mental model by just listening to the board
spoken aloud, or by listening to idnividual cells by navigating
to them.</p>

<p>Here are the set of additional interactive commands that
needed to be added in order to be able to play the game
effectively.</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>r</code></dt>
<dd>Speak current row.</dd>
<dt><code>c</code></dt>
<dd>Speak current column</dd>
<dt><code>s</code></dt>
<dd>Speak current sub-square.</dd>
<dt><code>R</code></dt>
<dd>Speak number of remaining cells in current row.</dd>
<dt><code>C</code></dt>
<dd>Speak number of remaining cells in current column.</dd>
<dt><code>S</code></dt>
<dd>Speak number of remaining cells in current sub-square.</dd>
<dt><code>d</code></dt>
<dd>Move to the sub-square below the current sub-square.</dd>
<dt><code>u</code></dt>
<dd>Move to the sub-square above the current sub-square.</dd>
<dt><code>n</code></dt>
<dd>Move to the next sub-square.</dd>
<dt><code>p</code></dt>
<dd>Move to the previous sub-square.</dd>
<dt><code>a</code></dt>
<dd>Move to the beginning of current row.</dd>
<dt><code>e</code></dt>
<dd>Move to the end of the current row.</dd>
<dt><code>t</code></dt>
<dd>Move to the top of the current column.</dd>
<dt><code>b</code></dt>
<dd>Move to the bottom of the current column.</dd>
<dt><code>,</code></dt>
<dd>Speaks information about the overall <em>distribution</em> of
numbers on the board.
<ul>
<li><code>d</code> --- Conveys how many instances of each digit
have been filled in.</li>
<li><code>s</code> --- Conveys number of remaining cells in each
sub-square.</li>
<li><code>r</code> --- Conveys number of remaining cells in each
row.</li>
<li><code>c</code> --- Conveys number of remaining cells in each
column.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><code>/</code></dt>
<dd>Speaks number of remaining cells in the current board.</dd>
<dt><code>.</code></dt>
<dd>Speaks value in current cell.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Notes on how invormation is spoken:</p>
<ul>
<li>Numbers are spoken in groups of 3 to achieve effective
intonation.</li>
<li>When navigating by sub-squares, point <em>always</em> moves
to the top left corner of the sub-square.</li>
<li>Additional commands bound to <code>M-r</code>,
<code>M-c</code> and <code>M-s</code> erase the current row,
column or sub-square respectively. These commands would probably
be convenient to have independent of whether one is using visual
output.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Effectiveness Of The Resulting Interface</h4>

<p>With the above interface in place, the simpler levels of the
game are a breeze, levels <em>difficult</em> and <em>evil</em>
are sufficiently challenging to be fun.</p>

<div>
<br><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Sourceforge is a nice service, but it can also be painful to
use because of the heavy-weight Web page design, and the need to
repeatedly click before you get the download you want.</p>
<p>The most irksome of these is the download mechanism provided
by Sourceforge --- where you first need to browse a list of
download servers, pick a mirror, and then download what you
want. 
Emacspeak implements a <em>Smart URL</em> that enables one to
download from Sourceforge in a single step.</p>
<p>By default, this uses a North American mirror; the behavior
can be customized if outside the US.
Use <em>smart URL</em> <code>Sourceforge Browse Mirror</code> and
specify the name of a SF hosted project when prompted.
This brings up the index page for the project's download area,
sorted by date. Move to the bottom of the page and   hit
<code>b</code> to move to the latest available download.</p>
<p>The <em>smart URL</em> sets up the W3 buffer with a
context-sensitive download function; when on a download link, hit
<code>C-d</code>
to start downloading. This command will prompt for the URL;
rather than hitting <code>return</code> (which would bring you to
the <em>browse mirrors</em> page, hit <code>M-p</code> to get the
download URL for your  SF mirror.
Note that this wizard uses <code>GNU wget</code> to perform the
download
via Emacs module <code>w3-wget</code>.</p>

<div>
<br><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>Since the BBC's various channels are what I listen to the
most, launching BBC channels has always been a couple of
keystrokes in Emacspeak. As a first step, directory
<code>realaudio/radio</code> contains shortcut files for
launching  live streams from the various BBC channels.</p>
<p>
In addition, module <code>emacspeak-url-template</code> defines a
number of <em>Smart URLs</em> for single-click access to BBC
programs. The ones I use the most are:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Smart URL</em> <code>BBC Channels On Demand</code>, and </li>
<li><em>Smart URL</em> <code>BBC Genres On Demand</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
These <em>smart URLs</em> prompt for the channel or genre
respectively and bring up a Web page that lists the various shows
that are available --- note that the BBC archives shows for a
whole week.
The resulting Web page is easy to browse in W3; the most
effective way to skim the buffer is to repeatedly hit
<code>i</code> which moves through the various items on the page.
Hitting <code>e e</code> (that's the letter <code>e</code>
<em>twice</em>) while on a hyperlink will launch the
corresponding media stream by calling   a <em>context-aware</em>
command that knows about transforming the URL to one that
accesses the program stream; --- note that simply following the
hyperlink will get you first to a page about the program, rather
than to the program stream itself.</p>
<p>To find out what channels and genres are available, browse the
BBC Web site --- channel and genre names are not hard-wired into
Emacspeak since these can change over time with channels and
genres being added or renamed.</p>

the user for the date, e.g. you can use <code>smart URL</code>
<em>NPR On Demand</em> to play  archived NPR shows.
</p>
<p>The most intuitive means of specifying a date is of course
using a <code>calendar</code> that functions as a
<em>date-picker</em>, and Emacs has a very powerful built-in
calendar. Emacspeak ties these two together by arranging for
commands that prompt for a date to use the <em>current date</em>
in the  Emacs Calendar as the default. So the easiest way to play
<em>NPR Morning Edition</em> for  <em>Monday, January 2, 2006</em>
is to do the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch to the Emacs Calendar and move to the desired date
<em>Monday January 2, 2006</em> by pressing <code>gd</code>.
</li>
<li>Invoke the <em>NPR On Demand</em> <code>smart URL</code> by

<p>While reading online texts on programming in Python and Ruby,
I noticed that Emacspeak was not announcing indented lines in
preformatted source-code examples, even with <code>audio
indentation</code> turned on.
The reason is that many of these texts use an HTML non-breaking
space for indentation, and though W3 was rendering these
correctly, the default syntax table in W3 had not defined the
resulting <code>octal 240</code> to be of class
white-space. Consequently, Emacspeak's audio indentation code was
not treating the non-breaking space as white space.</p>
<p>I've checked in a patch to <code>emacspeak-w3.el</code> that
modifies the syntax table in <code>w3-mode</code>
by adding the appropriate lines to <code>w3-mode-hook</code>.

        hand-in-hand with script <code>etc/rivo.pl</code>
        to provide a simple <strong>record for later playback</strong>
        facility that can be used to record live realaudio streams for
        future playback. This is useful for  listening to live broadcasts
      at a more convenient time.</p>
      <p>Wizard <code>emacspeak-wizrds-rivo</code> prompts for the time
      at which to record, the length of the recording, the stream to
      record, and the location in which the recording is to be stored.
      It then uses command <code>trplayer</code> (text-mode RealPlayer)
      with command  <code>vsound</code>
      to capture the audio stream, and  converts the result to MP3
      using command <code>lame</code>.
      ToDo: With <code>mplayer</code> now able to play RealAudio
      streams, the <code>etc/rivo.pl</code> script should be updated to
      use <code>mplayer</code> since this will :</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Remove the <code>vsound</code> dependency.</li>
        <li>Enable us to record more than just RealAudio streams.</li>
      </ul>

<div>
<br><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<p>
Emacs, and consequently Emacspeak, uses a number of multi-key
sequences. The initial key that makes up such a multi-key
sequence --- AKA the <code>prefix-key</code>
that leads to all Emacspeak commands is <code>C-e</code>
(<code>control-e)</code>.
</p>
<p>Pressing any <code>prefix-key</code> followed by the
<code>help-key</code> (<code>C-h</code>) results in Emacs
displaying a <strong>*Help*</strong> buffer that lists all
key-sequences beginning with that prefix. </p>

<p>This can be a very useful way of quickly seeing what keyboard
commands are available ---  as  the resulting listing is 
 shorter than what is produced by <code>C-h b</code> (command
describe-bindings) which lists all key-bindings.
</p>
<p>To  use this feature to review Emacspeak's
key-bindings, I have now moved command
<code>emacspeak-learn-emacs-mode</code> to <code>C-h C-l</code>
and <code>C-e F1</code>
from its original key-binding of <code>C-e C-h</code>  --- the
change is checked into CVS.</p>

</a></h2>
<div>
<br><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <p>
      New versions of the Linux <code>mplayer</code>
      can now play RealMedia files in addition to the various DVD and Windows audio and video streams.
      As an added bonus, <code>mplayer</code> can be built to use ALSA ---(note that default RPMs available on the Web still default to OSS as of December 2006).
    This, with the additional support for  newer RealMedia formats has finally caused me to switch away from <code>trplayer</code> a---a command line RealPlayer that was built against RealPlayer 8.0</p>
    <p>Note that building <code>mplayer</code> from source to include ALSA support, and locating all the  codecs you need will require a few Google searches. Specifically, to play NPR streams, you will need to grab <code>avisynth.dll</code> from the SourceForge project of the same name. But once this is done,
    <code>mplayer</code> will happily play multiple streams of audio without requiring multichannel support from the sound card. For Emacspeak users this means that you get auditory icons, and more importantly software TTS while listening to audio streams.</p>
    <p>
      To use software TTS while <code>mplayer</code> is playing audio streams requires that you use a TTS server that uses ALSA; the default Emacspeak servers still use OSS.
      To build a TTS server for IBM ViaVoice TTS, obtain Emacspeak sources from CVS, and follow the instructions in file <code>servers/linux-outloud/ALSA</code>.
    </p>
    <p>As of a few weeks ago, The Emacspeak CVS repository has been
    updated so that all access to streaming media goes through
    <code>mplayer</code> by default.  Make sure to configure your
    <code>mplayer</code> with a smaller cache size if you use it
    exclusively for streaming audio; by default it uses a rather
    large cache, and streaming realaudio often takes a long time to
    start before the cache is configured to be something smaller; I
    use a cache size of <code>64kb</code> on my laptop.</p>

I'm posting this using a bare-boned <code>atom-blogger</code> that I implemented this morning.
It uses <code>curl</code> to  process the HTTP Post Request.</p>
<h3>Editting Previous Entries</h3>
<p>What's more, the bare-bones atom-blogger can now edit previous posts.
This is done by getting the desired entry, filtering it for elements that should not be present when submitting updates, and adding a <code>generator</code> element --- all of these steps are required by the Blogger API.
Unwanted elements are filtered out using <code>xsltproc</code>.

<div>
<br><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

    
    <p>The Web browsing environment within Emacs is primitive compared to what is available in mainstream browsers today. However, the bare-bones Emacs/W3 within Emacspeak still provides a bagful of powerful tricks. 
    Here is how:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Module Emacspeak-websearch.el implements a set of powerful search wizards.
      </li>
      <li>Module emacspeak-url-template.el implements a library for programmable URLs.
      </li>
      <li>Additionally, the HTML received by W3 can be filtered via XSLT stylesheets.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Combining the above turns the Emacs minibuffer into a powerful Web CommandLine.
      The modules enumerated above were implemented within Emacspeak starting in 1998, with url-templates arriving circa early 2000.
      These tools were an access necessity due to the visual complexity of the Web; it's now interesting to see similar Web tools emerge on the mainstream web to help users complete tasks more rapidly.
      As an example, search Google for  
      <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22web+command+line%22">Web Command Line
      </a>
      --- you'll see that there are now simple browser add-ons for all the mainstream web browsers that implement similar shortcuts. Another popular means of achieving such Web shortcuts today is via simple Web widgets or portlets that are dropped into one's home page --- as an example, see 
      <a href="http://www.googlemodules.com/rss/latest.xml">Google Modules
      </a>.
